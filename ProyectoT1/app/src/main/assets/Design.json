    "characterDescription": "Design is the name that Wit has given to his liespren, or Cryptic.\r\nShe tells Kaladin that a dog can't become a dragon, thereby spoiling the end of one of Wit's stories (i.e., The Dog And The Dragon), which he has told her not to do. Her reasoning is that the story is really long, and that Kaladin needs to hear the ending so he'll know it's worth listening all the way.\r\nWit argues that a story needs drama, suspense and surprise, to which she replies that surprises are dumb. Further, that Kaladin should be informed if a product is good or not before being asked to commit to it.\r\nWit in turn tells Kaladin that he has bonded a literal monster.\r\nHowever, after Wit completes the story of The Dog And The Dragon, Design asks Kaladin if he missed 'the end' at the end."
