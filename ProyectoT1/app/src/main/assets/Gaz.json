    "characterDescription": "Gaz was a bridge sergeant who oversaw all of the bridgemen. He has expressed some regret over the way that they are treated, yet solely in his point of view. For some reason, he had to make regular payments to Lamaril, the Brightlord in charge of the bridgemen. It is later revealed that he was being blackmailed. After a while, he disappears.\r\nShallan later meets him on her way to the Shattered Plains, when Gaz has joined up with a band of deserters. When Shallan offers to give him and his companions a new life, Gaz says that he wouldn't mind starting over. She takes them on as her personal guard and Gaz goes with her to meet Dalinar for the first time. There, Gaz is confronted again with Kaladin, who had then become Captain of what once was the Cobalt Guard.\r\nWhen Gaz heard the screams for help from another caravan being attacked by bandits, he began jogging toward them. Others broke off and followed him."
