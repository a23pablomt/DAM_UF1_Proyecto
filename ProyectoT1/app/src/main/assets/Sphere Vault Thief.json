    "characterDescription": "The Sphere Vault thief poses as a member of Queen Fen's guard in order to gain entry into her personal vault in effort to steal the King's Drop.\r\nInitially, he follows Vstim, after Rysn, into the vault. Then, he assists Tlik in carrying Rysn (who doesn't know his name) into the main vault chamber.\r\nAs Rysn is touching the King's Drop gem, and describing its unique characteristics to Vstim, the thief kills Tlik with a knife to the neck, then slashes at Vstim, who raises the alarm.\r\nThe murderer then reaches into the vault to deal with Rysn's babsk, and she hears a grunt.\r\nA moment later, the traitor steps out, carrying the King's Drop in his hand, and kicks the door to the vault closed, locking Vstim away.\r\nOne of Fladm's crossbow bolts then hits him, and another, but ... the thief doesn't seem to notice.\r\nPicking up Tlik's abandoned crossbow, the thief fires a crossbow down a row of gemstone racks, and connects with Fladm's flesh, killing him.\r\nDespite the crossbow bolts imbedded in his flesh, Rysn notices that the man is healing and wonders if he might be a Knight Radiant.\r\nHe engages four more guards who've joined the fight, stabs one, and then another screams.\r\nThe bald man - his clothing ripped, his sword dripping blood in his shadowed hand - eventually appears before Rysn, who has acquired and made off with the gemstone, plus Fladm's crossbow and bolts.\r\nChiri-Chiri, having illegally made it inside the vault when Rysn first entered, succeeds in feeding off the thief, thereby draining him of the dark violet light that permeated his being (likely Voidlight, given its hue), thus revealing him to be a marble-skinned parshman as his face melted away.\r\nAs the thief lunges for her, Rysn fires a crossbow bolt at him, which takes him in the chin, drops him, and he falls still."
