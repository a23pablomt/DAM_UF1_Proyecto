    "characterDescription": "Vathah is the leader of a band of deserters (including Gaz and Shob) whom Shallan meets on her way to the Shattered Plains.\r\nWhen Shallan asks him what he would do to erase the past, Vathah tells her that they can't change the past.\r\nShe tells him that she can change their future, to which he says that they are wanted men.\r\nShe then tells him that she came there wanting men. Hoping to find men.\r\nWhen he then looked away from her, she knew she'd lost him. He barked the order to take her captive.\r\nHe was incredulous that his companions were considering her offer, and reminded them that they left to get away from their oppressors.\r\nAfter Gaz and some other deserters had jogged toward where another caravan was being attacked by bandits, Vathah left with those who'd remained behind, marching toward the fighting.\r\nAfter the bandits were dispatched, Vathah executed those still alive one by one. He'd lost seven soldiers in the battle.\r\nHe then tells Shallan that his men had done worse things than that. In the wilderness, they took and killed.\r\nFurther, that if they go with her to the Shattered Plains, they're dead men. That they'll be hanged the moment they return.\r\nHe is eventually pardoned by former King Elhokar and becomes Shallan's guard captain.[citation\u00a0needed]"
