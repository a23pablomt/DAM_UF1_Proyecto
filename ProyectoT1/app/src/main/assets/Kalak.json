He is assumed to have founded - and to be the patron Herald of - the order of Knights Radiant known as Willshapers.\r\nHe was later known as Kelek - as he is still known in modern Alethkar - due to a vowel shift in the language between time periods.\r\nHis name is a favored curse word for Teft.\r\nIn Rhythm of War, Kelek is the High Judge of the honorspren in Shadesmar. He presides over Adolin's trial. He says Adolin isn't a smart one for offering to be tried for the Recreance. He tells Adolin that Tanavast is completely dead and that this world is doomed as it belongs to Odium now.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\nKelek complains to his Honorspen assistant that they even let Adolin into Lasting Integrity. He also complains after years of joining the honorspren they still don't have a way for him to get off this cursed world.[citation\u00a0needed]",
