    "characterDescription": "Renarin Kholin is a Brightlord of Alethkar, Prince of House Kholin, and the younger son of Highprince Dalinar and Evi Kholin, and younger brother to Adolin. Through his father, he is the nephew of the late King Gavilar and his then wife and Queen Navani, the cousin of now Queen Jasnah and her brother, former King Elhokar. He is also a first cousin once removed to Elhokar's and his wife Aesudan's son Gavinor as a member of House Kholin.\r\nSince childhood, Renarin has supposedly suffered an illness referred to as 'blood weakness'.* Initially, he does not possess either a Shardblade or Shardplate.\u00a0Adolin wins a Shardblade for his brother in his first serious duel, as part of the plan to take Shards away from the other highprinces. Renarin is given his father's Shardplate when Dalinar decides to turn over field command of his forces to Adolin and devote himself to leadership."
