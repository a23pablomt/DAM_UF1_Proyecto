He once added lazbo to a bin of shiki, much to Rock's horror, but once Rock tasted it, he found that Huio had improved his own recipe.\r\nWhen Rock asks the bridgemen who came to him stating that they no longer felt they fit in with Bridge Four, Huio responds that he has trouble, that this makes him embarrassed, and alone.\r\nIt's likely that Huio bonded with Caelinora after the Battle of Thaylen Field since Huio had only then become a Radiant squire.",
