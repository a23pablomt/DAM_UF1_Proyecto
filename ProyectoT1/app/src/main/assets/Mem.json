        "Beliefs": "She believes there is an art to doing laundry.\r\nFurther, she believes that everyone knows the basics, but doesn't believe they know how to relax the fibers of a stubborn seasilk dress by returning it to a warm brine, then restore its natural softness by rinsing it and brushing with the grain. She also doesn't believe they could spot the difference between a mineral dye from Azir and a floral dye from the Veden slopes, because one used different soaps for each one.\r\nFurther still, she believes that the need for clean clothing outlived disasters. That the end of the world could come, but it would only mean more bloodstains to wash.",
        "Characteristics": "To Mem, a ripping sound inspires terror. The sound of a seam splitting, or of a delicate chemise tearing as it catches on part of a washtub. It is the sound of disaster incarnate.",
