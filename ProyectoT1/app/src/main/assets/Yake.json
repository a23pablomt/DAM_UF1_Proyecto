In a bridge run, he caught an arrow in his arm.\r\nYake is one of three bridgemen (the others being Moash and Teft) who were the first brought to be introduced to fighting with a Shardblade under the tutelage of Zahel. He contradict's Zahel's description of Shardblades as being \"just a tool.\"\r\nWhen training a bulk of Windrunner squire hopefuls, Yake slaps Rlain on the back and tells him that should show them how a real bridgeman does a kata.\r\n"
