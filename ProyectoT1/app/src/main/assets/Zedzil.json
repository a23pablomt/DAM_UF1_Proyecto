    "characterDescription": "Zedzil is a Skybreaker squire under the tutelage of Master Warren.\r\nIn the game of targeting other trainees with pouches of differently colored powders (which is part of their training), Zedzil falls in behind Szeth, holding a pouch in each hand.\r\nZedzil follows as Szeth shoots upward like an arrow, but when he tries to throw a pouch at Szeth, the wind is too great. The pouch falls backward immediately, striking Zedzil on his own shoulder.\r\nSzeth then drops into a dive, and Zedzil follows until Szeth snatches a green bag from a pole and tosses it over his shoulder, hitting Zedzil again. The younger man curses, then shoots away to find easier prey.",
