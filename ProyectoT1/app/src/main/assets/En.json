    "characterDescription": "En is a slave that Shallan released from a cage whilst traveling to the Shattered Plains. She encouraged him to act as a footman while she utilized Sebarial's carriage to travel to the Outer Market where Adolin would be waiting for her. En had said that he'd done the job before and smiled at her. She inquires of him as to whether he is being treated well, to which he replies positively. She then also asks him if he'd tell her if he weren't, to which he - somewhat awkwardly - replies that he would.",
