    "characterDescription": "Nall is the head ardent of the Alethi sword fighting practice grounds. She has recorded the suits between sword fighters in her drawings.\r\nShallan bows to her upon her own arrival to the practice grounds, but then berates the ardent for the pathetic records of suits between sword fighters that the ardent had recorded, and insists that new sketches are required.\r\nShallan hands Nall a portfolio of her own sketches, and Nall comments that Shallan's talent is admirable. Nall then questions Shallan whether Art is her Calling. Shallan responds that Natural History is her Calling, but that sketching in that line of study is a priority for her as well.\r\nNall then confirms that Shallan's Calling is as it should be and gives Shallan her blessing.\r\nWhen Adolin inquires of Sister Nall why she's letting Shallan stay, the sister tells him that Shallan wishes to update the royal record of Shardplate and Shardblades in the warcamps with new sketches. Further, she tells him that this seems wise because the king's current accounting of the Shards includes many rough sketches, but few detailed drawings.\r\nWhen Shallan states that she'll focus first on the King's Plate and Blades, Nall tells her to just stay out of the way of the men sparring ... then walks away.",
