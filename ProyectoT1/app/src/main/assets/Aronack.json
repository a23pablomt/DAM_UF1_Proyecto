        "Notes": "Aronack is no longer canon because, before the cosmere was fully formed, he was one amongst those considered to be demigods, but Brandon later decided it was more interesting for the Shards to have been (mostly) ordinary mortals before the Shattering.\r\nStill, Aronack was basically breaking the agreement between the others of his kind by giving rapid technological development to his people. This was, in part, because Brandon was intrigued by the idea of a single highly-advanced (in technology) culture among a group of bronze age peoples. An idea readers see play out in science fiction (with advanced aliens among modern cultures on earth) but not often in fantasy. (Except in some versions of \"old world meets new world\" style recreations of what happened on Earth.)",
