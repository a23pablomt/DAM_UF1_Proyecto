    "characterDescription": "Rind is Highprince Dalinar's head quartermaster in his warcamp. He is a lighteyed Alethi soldier of the tenth dahn, but what is known as a \"tenner\", a lowly rank barely above darkeyes.\r\nHe tells Kaladin that he has what stock remained of the uniforms for the Cobalt Guard, but that he's commissioned some new ones for the members of Bridge Four.\r\nHe further explains that Dalinar's new members of the Guard are to be outfitted with breastplates, steel caps, and new spears. Plus, chain mail for the battlefield, if they need it.\r\nAs he distributes the uniforms* to the men, he gives Shen a strange look, but delivers the parshman a uniform without complaint.\r\nAn exasperated Rind explains to the men how to do up the coats, then reacts with horror as Skar cuts the patch bearing the insignia of the Cobalt Guard off his shoulder. The others agreed, cutting off the patches, tossing them to the ground.\r\nKaladin tells Rind that he'll draw up a glyphpair insignia for him to use in order to commission new patches. The portly man just sighs as he gathers up the discarded patches.\r\nLater, Rind makes a rope ladder for Kaladin, so he can climb down to the chasms of the Shattered Plains. Rind is initially confused by the request, but constructs the ladder well."
