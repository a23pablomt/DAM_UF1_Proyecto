        "History": "Kaladin remembered holding her hand as she was dying. He'd promised to help the older woman find her husband, who'd been sold to another household. That wasn't supposed to be legal, but one could get away with doing all kinds of things to slaves with the right brands, especially if they were foreign.\r\nWhen Kaladin had tugged on her hand to move while they were attempting to escape, and she'd resisted, he understood her hesitation.\r\nHe tugged again, and she passed the signal to the next slave, all the way down the line. Then she clung to his hand as he led them toward a remembered game trail.\r\nThe snapping sound of a trap closing sent a jolt through Kaladin. When it got Nalma, she yanked her hand from his as she screamed.\r\nNext to Kaladin, her leg was caught in a fierce steel trap - a thing of springs and jaws that one wouldn't even use on a beast, for fear of ruining the sport. Her tibia jutted through her skin.\r\nKaladin tried to stanch the blood, but it spurted between his fingers.\r\nHe then uselessly made a bandage as Nalma tried to push him away, to make him run. He took her hand and held it instead, weeping as she died.",
