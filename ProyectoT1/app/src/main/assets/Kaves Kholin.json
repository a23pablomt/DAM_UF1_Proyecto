    "characterDescription": "Kaves Kholin was a distant relative of House Kholin who had often tried to gain power in Kholinar. Veil saw him and his attendants as remnants in a line of corpses there. Neither Adolin nor Elhokar were sad to see him go, but his death whispered of a continuing mystery. More than thirty people had gone into the palace to meet with the queen in the city, many more powerful than Kaves. Still, no one knew what had happened to them ... until Sidin told Adolin that the queen had him killed."
