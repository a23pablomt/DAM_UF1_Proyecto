    "characterDescription": "A master-servant is one who responds to a sign of need (i.e., a particular hand gesture) for service, often at the king's feast.\r\nPrior to the assassination of Jasnah's father, she passes a master-servant in the hallways of Kholinar Palace, who bows to her.\r\nAt the king's feasts, highborn men and women settle themselves in lavish chairs. Beside each one is a small table and behind that, a master-servant for important needs.\r\nOne master-servant informs Dalinar that a wrestling match will have to be canceled. He tells Bashin that the opponent of Makh, the wrestler, has stomach problems."
