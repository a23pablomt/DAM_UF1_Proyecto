    "characterDescription": "Thaidakar is a leader of the Ghostbloods. His purpose, while ultimately unknown, was likely in opposition to that of Brightlord\u00a0Amaram. King Gavilar mentioned him as a potential suspect for his assassination before Szeth (Gavilar's assassin) told him that the Parshendi were behind it.\r\nThaidakar was also mentioned by Amaram when discussing the death of the Shardbearer (i.e., Helaran) who nearly killed him, at which time Amaram appeared to hint that Thaidakar was linked to the Ghostbloods.\r\nThaidakar is mentioned by Mraize with regard to the drawings Shallan made from the interior of Amaram's manor, reinforcing his connection to the Ghostbloods. The drawings were to be delivered to him.\r\nThaidakar is also Kelsier from the Mistborn series of novels, revealed as the Lord of Scars (as Wit calls him)."
