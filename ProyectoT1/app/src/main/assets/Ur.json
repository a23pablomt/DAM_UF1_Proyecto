    "characterDescription": "Ur is one of the thieves that Veil encounters at the tavern, All's Alley, in Urithiru.\r\nHe removes her from 'his' seat at a table, which she has appropriated, only to be confronted by her in return. When she places her safehand on his hand - a strangely intimate gesture - it confuses him. When she places the point of her knife onto the back of her hand, which is pressed against his, it further confuses him. When she rams the knife down through her hand, through his, and into the tabletop, he screams, and whips his hand upward, thereby making her pull the knife out of both hands. He topples out of his chair, scrambles away, then accuses her of being crazy.",
