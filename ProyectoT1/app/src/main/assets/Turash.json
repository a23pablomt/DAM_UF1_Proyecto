    "characterDescription": "Turash is a stormform listener whom Odium compliments about looking well in his new body. Further, he tells him that his mind holds firm and that he is proud of him.\r\nWhen asked by Odium what he thinks of their army\u2019s prize (i.e., Thaylen City), Turash tells him that it is an excellent position of great import, even without the Oathgate there. Still, he fears for their armies because they are weak, untrained, and frightened. He expresses that many within their ranks may refuse to fight because they don\u2019t crave vengeance. He thinks that even with the presence of the thunderclast amongst them, they may be outmatched.",
