    "characterDescription": "Ishar is one of the ten Heralds of the Almighty, the Herald of Luck. He is associated with the number Ishi, the essence Sinew, and the divine attributes Pious and Guiding. He is the patron Herald of the order of Knights Radiant known as Bondsmiths.\r\nIshar speculated that if only one Herald remained bound to the Oathpact, that it would be sufficient. All of the Heralds (except for Taln) used this reasoning to abandon the Oathpact, during the time that became known as the Last Desolation."
