    "characterDescription": "Pai was an ardent - and Lhan's protege - who sought admittance to the former Alethi queen's retinue of the ardentia. She sought to be an example for all to follow; to bring truth and true contemplation of the Almighty to the queen's court.\r\nPai was of the Devotary of Denial. As such, she sought to experience separation from the physical needs of her body. She was appalled by the waste of uneaten food and the cost of gluttony.\r\nShe wrote large glyphs on the floors of the Alethi People's Hall, listing the ten foolish attributes, as represented by the ten fools.* Further, she denounced in women's script how the queen exemplified each of them. Such action resulted in her execution and the subsequent commencement of the Kholinar riots."
