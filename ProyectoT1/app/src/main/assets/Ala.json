    "characterDescription": "Ala - pronounced A-lay - is a spren that was trapped inside a cube belonging to Mraize. With help from Kelek, Shallan and Adolin had gotten it open without harming the creature.\r\nNo one recognizes the variety of spren, but Wit calls it a seon (i.e., from the world Sel of Elantris).\r\nShallan tells Ala that it can come out of the cube, that it doesn't need to live in there anymore. But Ala responds that it's supposed to stay, that it's not supposed to talk. To her. To anyone.\r\nShallan thinks that the odd spren resists attempts to get it free, that it acts like an abused child. Radiant thinks that this is yet another of Mraize's crimes.",
