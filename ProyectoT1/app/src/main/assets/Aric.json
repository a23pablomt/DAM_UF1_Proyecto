    "characterDescription": "Aric is the soldier who apprehends Kaladin as he is skulking about Hearthstone post-Everstorm.\r\nKaladin allows him to escort him into Roshone's manor there, and he walks Kaladin along a candlelit hallway, then passes through the kitchens.\r\nWhen Kaladin hears a moan close by, he asks the soldier whether there are wounded therein, to which the soldier replies \"Yeah, but ... .\"\r\nAs Kaladin then encounters his father, the soldier catches up with him, shouldering past gawking townspeople and waving his mace toward Kaladin like a baton. Kaladin sidesteps absently, then pushes the man so he stumbles farther down the hallway.\r\nLater, after Kaladin has brandished Syl as a Shardblade to establish ranking order in the town, Aric addresses Kaladin as Brightlord and tells him that the town's parshmen were gone when they went back to check on them. That they'd locked the door to their quarters, but the side was ripped clean open.\r\nLater still, after having given Kaladin his name, Aric describes the passing of the parshmen through the town. He says that they looked like Voidbringers, with \" ... big bony bits jutting from their skin.\"\r\nAric then asks of Kaladin to tell the king of Hearthstone's plight. That the storm had ripped away four of their silos. That they'll be starving before too long, with all the refugees flooding into the town and no food to provide. That when the highstorms start coming again, they won't have half as many homes as they need.\r\nAfter Roshone's death and the fall of Alethkar, Aric is forbidden weapons by the Fused. He organizes the line of refugees from Herdaz into Hearthstone, and keeps anyone from sneaking into town before Lirin sees them."
