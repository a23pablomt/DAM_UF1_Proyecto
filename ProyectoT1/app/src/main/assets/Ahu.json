    "characterDescription": "Ahu was a beggar at the court of King Gavilar in Kholinar.\r\nDalinar found Ahu at the back of the Beggars' Porch, huddled in the shadows between two large religious statues, and spoke with him there. His greeting: \"have you seen me?\"\r\nDalinar told him that he was a strange little man, but Ahu told Dalinar that he liked him. That he liked the pain in Dalinar's eyes. Friendly pain. Companionable pain.\r\nAhu then asked Dalinar just which of those amongst some of the Unmade had gotten to him, but Dalinar had no idea what he was talking about.\r\nThe Fused assign Moash to kill a king with a strange golden dagger with a gem in the pommel. He goes to the beggars and finds a madman who asks, \"have you seen me?\" ... Jezrien, King of Heralds."
