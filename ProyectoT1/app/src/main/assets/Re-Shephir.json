        "Appearance": "Shallan sees a dark mass wriggling deep inside slits within the tower of Urithiru, squeezing between walls like goo, but with bits jutting out. These bits appear as elbows, ribs, fingers splayed along a wall, each knuckle bending backward.\r\nThe thing twists, head deforming in the tiny confines, and looks toward her. Shallan sees eyes reflecting her Stormlight, twin spheres set in a mashed head, a distorted human visage.\r\nLater identified as Re-Shephir, she appears as a large mass that reflects the light, like glistening tar. She is an undulating shape, a living darkness that seeps, though not swiftly.",
