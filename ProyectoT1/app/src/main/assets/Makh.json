    "characterDescription": "Makh is a wrestler who is said to have never been defeated.\r\nWhen told that his bout was to be cancelled, due to his opponent's stomach illness, he argues with several of the lighteyed organizers, pointing at the ring, angerspren boiling on the floor around him.\r\nDalinar offers to fight the man, but Makh tells him that this was to be a freeform bout, all hits and holds allowed. When Dalinar asks him if he's worried about injuring his highprince, Dalinar promises Makh clemency for anything done to himself.\r\nMakh tells Dalinar that hurting him is not what what he's afraid of. He shivers visibly, and a Thaylen woman - perhaps his manager - smacks him on the arm. The wrestler bows and backs away.",
