        "Appearance": "After having embraced that power, Demid's clothing is in tatters, his well-muscled body isn't scored. He stands tall - far taller than Venli - with a broad chest and powerful stance. He seems more like a statue than a listener. He flexes, eyes glowing red, and his body pulses with a dark violet power - a glow that somehow evokes both light and darkness at once. It retreats, but Demid is pleased by his ability to invoke it.\r\nTo Venli, he appears majestic, with ridges of carapace poking through his skin along the arms and at the corners of his face.\r\nHe doesn't stand like her once-mate, or speak like him.",
