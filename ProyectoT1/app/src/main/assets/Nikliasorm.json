They were stranded on the island together to keep them from interfering, but Plamry was left alone when Nikli melted into bugs.\n",

        "Notes": "Also according to Brandon, he didn't have viewpoints from Nikli originally, because he wanted to maintain the mystique of the Sleepless. He realized after the beta read that the coolness of seeing through their eyes was more important, and that indeed there was an issue with Dawnshard. He expected, because people had read Oathbringer, and the scene in Oathbringer, that they would immediately pick out who the horde - the Aimian - on the crew was. The tattoos were supposed to make it very obvious what was going on.",
