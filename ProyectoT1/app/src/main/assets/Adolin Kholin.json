    "characterDescription": "Adolin Kholin is a Brightlord, the elder son of  Dalinar and Evi Kholin, Renarin's elder brother, and Dalinar's heir. Through his father, he is the nephew of the late King Gavilar and his then wife and queen, Navani, the cousin of his now queen, Jasnah, and former king, Elhokar. He is also a first cousin once removed to Elhokar's and his wife Aesudan's son, Gavinor, as a member of House Kholin.\r\nHe is a full Shardbearer and inherited his Shardplate through his mother; he won his Shardblade through a duel with Tinalar. He paints his Shardplate blue. Like his father, he is one of a dozen men who ride a Ryshadium horse. His horse, Sureblood, is described as completely white. His father is training him as a leader, increasingly delegating visible and responsible military assignments to him."
