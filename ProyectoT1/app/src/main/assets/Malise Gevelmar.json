    "characterDescription": "Malise Gevelmar was the youngest of Brightlord Gevelmar's daughters, and was less than ten years older than Shallan herself. She married Brightlord Lin Davar shortly after Shallan's mother died, and was left in charge of Shallan's education. However, like in many rural Veden houses, she'd received little training herself and was incompetent in this respect, having very little influence on Shallan as a result.\r\nMalise was beaten to death (several blows to her head) by her husband after Shallan and her brother, Balat, had planned to take her to safety. Lin had murdered her as punishment.",
