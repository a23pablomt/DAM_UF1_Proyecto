When she is then approached by Wit - who asks her questions, to which she doesn't respond - Cob remains observant, but silent.\r\nWhen Wit eventually carries a little girl to Kheni, tells her that someone needs to care for the girl, and she then takes the child into her arms, Cob takes Wit by the arm, smiling. When he then asks Wit if he might stay a little longer, Wit tells him that he is the first to have ever asked him that.",
