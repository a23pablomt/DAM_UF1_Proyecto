He is considered to be the learned one in the group of six men - inclusive of Huqin, Gawx, and Maxin - because he can cuss in three languages.\r\nTigzikk insists that there will be chaos and danger in the Palace because there will be both many people and many bodyguards within it on the night they've chosen to infiltrate it. He is also the one who suggested the infiltration.",
