    "characterDescription": "Evi Kholin was Dalinar's wife and is the mother of Adolin and Renarin. Dalinar married Evi because she and her brother, Toh, sought asylum from Rira within Alethkar, and because they sought to exchange a suit of Shardplate in order to do so.*\r\nDalinar had wished he'd felt more for her. Some passion, some true emotion. He couldn't laugh without her seeming confused by the conversation. He couldn't boast without her being disappointed in his bloodlust. She always wanted him to hold her, as if being alone for one minute would make her wither and blow away.\r\nLater, due to Dalinar's visit to the Nightwatcher (et al.), he could no longer hear his wife's name. Instead, he heard rushing air (i.e., Shshshsh). He could go weeks without even noticing this hole in his memories, this change that had ripped out a piece of him and left him patched over. Without even a prick of emotion when her name, which he could not hear, was mentioned.\r\nReferences to Evi Kholin prior to those in Oathbringer mostly appear within The Way of Kings in Dalinar's visions. Dalinar is unable to recall the features of her face, and he remembers her as a blur.\r\nThe reason that Dalinar was unable to recall his wife's face or hear her name was originally thought to be because he'd made a deal with the Nightwatcher because she grants a boon in exchange for a curse via use of the Old Magic. It is unknown whether Dalinar's inability to remember his wife was the given curse or the boon."
