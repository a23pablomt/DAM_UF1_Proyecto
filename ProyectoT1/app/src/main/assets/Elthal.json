He'd been one of those to hold the gap alongside Dalinar during the last part of the fight.\r\nDalinar directed him to take the wounded to his warcamp, then tell Teleb to bring the entire camp to alert and mobilize the remaining companies.\r\nElthal saluted Dalinar and was told to prepare for anything, but hopefully nothing, then left to follow his orders.",
