His beard is of a cut with the chin shaved, almost like a Horneater, but with a thin mustache and a sculpted line of hair that runs from it up his cheeks and blends into his sideburns.\r\nNotum has also appeared as an Alethi man, sturdy and tall, with close-cropped hair. While he did have a beard somewhat like that of a Horneater, with prominent sideburns running down his cheeks, he maintained that additional thin mustache. It, along with his simple clothing, was all part of him.",
