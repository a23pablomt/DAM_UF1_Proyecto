    "characterDescription": "Kheni is a wife and mother encountered by Wit who still rocks the empty cradle of her baby, staring with haunted eyes across the square of Kholinar. Her husband hovers nearby.\r\nShe doesn't respond to Wit's questions of her, but when he asks her if he should put one of his eyes out, she looks at him, incredulous. He then pats her on the shoulder, acknowledging that she is listening to him.\r\nHe then tells her to just wait where she is.\r\nHe returns with a little girl in his arms and tells Kheni that he has to leave the city and someone needs to take care of the child. Kheni then holds out her arms and Wit puts the girl into them. Kheni's husband takes him by the arm, smiling."
