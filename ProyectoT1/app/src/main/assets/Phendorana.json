    "characterDescription": "Phendorana was an honorspren with a level of significance and\/or command amongst those of her kind.\r\nShe appeared to Rock on a plateau of the Shattered Plains along with two dozen or more of her kind. They glowed a faint blue, and clustered around her, swirling about in the air, their focus the practicing bridgemen - and would-be squires - learning to draw Stormlight into themselves.\r\nAfter Rock made the Unkalaki signs of respect toward the spren woman, Syl told Rock that he is so wonderfully respectful, and that it borders on being silly.\r\nWhen he asked Syl whether they - collectively - are her kin, and if the woman at their front was her nuatoma, she told him that they kind of are, and that Phendorana was ... maybe.\r\nSyl told Rock that they wouldn't speak to her. She thought that they assumed that if they did, they'd have to admit to her that they were wrong about her with regard to her search for Kaladin. And, that they absolutely hated being wrong.\r\nPhendorana studied Rock, then rested her hand over one of the bowls containing spheres that he'd arranged for her, and drew out the Stormlight. Afterward, she left, turning into a streak of light and zipping away.\r\nThe other spren remained, a mottled collection of clouds, ribbons, people, bunches of leaves, and other natural objects. They flitted overhead, watching the practicing men and women."
