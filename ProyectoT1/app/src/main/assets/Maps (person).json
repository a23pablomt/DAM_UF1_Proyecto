    "characterDescription": "Maps was a bridgeman in Bridge Four. Everyone called him Maps because of the birthmark on his chest that he claimed to be an exact map of Alethkar. He was good at making people feel at ease and had shown Kaladin kindness on his first day as a bridgeman.\r\nMaps was the bridgeman who presented Rock with the crew's gift of a straight razor - plus a piece of polished steel for a mirror, beard soap, and a leather strap for sharpening - to thank Rock for making stew for the crew each night."
