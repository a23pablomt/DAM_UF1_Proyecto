    "characterDescription": "Ym was a cobbler who made shoes in the old way. He'd observed that a \"sparkling light spren\" made increasingly frequent visits to his shop and that it was a kind of spren he'd not seen before. Ym spoke to the spren while working and it responded: \"He comes.\" \r\nWhile Ym treated a cut on the foot of a young street urchin, he held a broam in his hand, the light from which vanished as he healed the cut and removed the infection. He knew the spren was involved in what he did. For the shoes he made for the urchin, Ym asked for his story.\r\nAfter the urchin left, the spren warned him: \"He's still here ... .\" A man with dark, Makabaki skin emerged from the shadows and confronted Ym with his past. After a brief chase, the man killed Ym with a Shardblade shoved through his chest."
