    "characterDescription": "Ned was an angry drunk from Sadeas's warcamp who always got into trouble. According to Betha, he killed his wife by strangling her. According to another, they all knew Ned would go too far at some point, so they weren't surprised when, after she tried to drag him away from All's Alley that night, she wound up dead.\r\nFurther, again according to Betha, he killed one of the barmaids from All's Alley the following night. Since she and her fellow thieves couldn\u2019t let that pass because they protect the tavern, Ur had to take a long walk with him and Ned finally went over the edge of a cliff.\r\nAgain, according to another, it was strange that Ned would've come back and killed a barmaid the night after he'd killed his wife, and that he'd left the barmaid's body right around the corner from where he'd killed his wife. According to Ur, Ned screamed the whole time he was being taken to his fall that he hadn't killed the barmaid."
