    "characterDescription": "Nergaoul is one of the Unmade, a mysterious group of odious spren on Roshar. He is ancient, evil, and one such with which Taravangian hasn't the resources to tackle. Adrotagia implies that Nergaoul is a Voidspren, or perhaps an Unmade connected somehow  with the Thrill.\r\nAccording to Taravangian, the Thrill only affects people who are in a certain proximity to Nergaoul.\r\nNergaoul's power was once bound to the proximity around Alethkar, but with Taravangian's conquest of Jah Keved, it has moved further west."
