    "characterDescription": "Kaza was a member of the Liaforan royal family who attempted to visit Akinah in Aimia, on the First Dreams (with a crew of sailors), seeking a cure for her Soulcasting savantism and to uncover the secrets therein.\r\nAfter the entire crew and Kaza were poisoned by the cook (who described Kaza as being barely human), Kaza slowly gave in to the desire of smoke transcendence while Soulcasting - rather than dying by poison - though she resisted its affects much longer than everyone else on the ship."
