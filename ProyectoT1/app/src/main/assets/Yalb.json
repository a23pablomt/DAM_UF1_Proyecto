    "characterDescription": "Yalb was a sailor on the Wind's Pleasure from rural Thaylenah. He accompanied Shallan to the Conclave in Kharbranth, translating the porter's comments for her and refusing a bribe to gouge her on the price. She paid him a fire emerald for his aid and, later painting him, tried to capture the way he had flirted with her. When she returned, he had won eighty chips off guards by cheating them at kabers.\r\nHe helped Shallan buy books for a very good price by conning the bookseller Artmyrn into believing that he - Yalb - is an agent of Barmest (i.e., Artmyrn's biggest rival) who can offer the books Shallan needs at a lower price, again showing his skill at deception. She rewarded Yalb for this by giving him her painting of him and the porter.\r\nYalb later told Shallan that she was good luck as they aboard the Wind's Pleasure hadn't seen a santhid in years.\r\nYalb was aboard the Wind's Pleasure when the Ghostbloods attacked it and its sailors in an attempt to murder Jasnah. The Wind's Pleasure was then sunk by Shallan - and Pattern - when she convinced the ship it would be doing its crew one last service to save them.",
