    "characterDescription": "Toralin Roshone\u00a0was the citylord of Hearthstone.\r\nHe owned neither Shardplate nor a Shardblade. His allies were Brightlord Sadeas, his liege lord, and Brightlord Amaram, his distant cousin. \r\nFollowing the death of Brightlord Wistiow in 1166, Roshone was appointed as Hearthstone's citylord as a part of his exile conditions.\r\nAccording to Kaladin, Hearthstone was cursed with his presence, a man whose greedy ways had ruined far more than one life.\r\nRoshone wasn't important enough to have stewardship over any of the highprince's lands - a distinction Kaladin had never realized while he lived in Hearthstone. Those lands were watched over by much more important lighteyes; Roshone was only a first point of contact with surrounding villages."
