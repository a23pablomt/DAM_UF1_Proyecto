    "characterDescription": "The Drummer brothers are acquaintances of Puuli. Puuli helped them by pulling a tattered sail from the surf and stretching it out on the rocks after the Everstorm had past through their little port on the crumbling eastern edge of Roshar. Puuli also told them that the storm was truly tragic, even as he is secretly happy about it."
