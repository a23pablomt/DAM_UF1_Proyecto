The compound fracture spurt red where bone had split the skin because one of the girl's lower leg arteries was severed.\r\nWhile Kaladin thought that he could save her (a 13-year-old himself at the time), the girl's blood loss was\u00a0too great. Her father, Harl, is left distraught and wailing upon her death."
