    "characterDescription": "Nikliasorm, or Nikli, is a Dysian Aimian on Roshar. Though young for it's species, Nikli is at least 400 years old.  According to Brandon, Nikli is the youngest (and the twenty-fourth) swarm on Roshar.\r\nNot only did he poison the ship's pet, but he placed worms in stores of grain to make Rysn and her crew turn back from Aimia.\r\nNikli was both Plamry's friend and his superior. They were stranded on the island together to keep them from interfering, but Plamry was left alone when Nikli melted into bugs.\n"
