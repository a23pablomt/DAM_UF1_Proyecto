    "characterDescription": "Gavashaw moved into Bornwater and opened his own gambling den to challenge Makkek. He was considered to be an interloper there.\r\nLikely, he hadn't believed the reputation of Makkek's phantom assassin. He'd had reason to be skeptical. Szeth's reputation was inaccurate as he was far more dangerous than it suggested.\r\nGavashaw was to be assassinated (by order of Makkek, who was in possession of Szeth's Oathstone at the time), but the method was up to Szeth. He picked one that would not require killing the man's guards. Still, when Szeth arrived to do so, Gavashaw had already been killed."
