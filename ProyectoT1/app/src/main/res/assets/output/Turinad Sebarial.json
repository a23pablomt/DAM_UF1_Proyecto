His banner bears the glyphs sebes and laial stylized into a skyeel, deep gold on a black field.\r\nSebarial hosted Shallan Davar in his warcamp after being maneuvered into it upon her arrival on the Shattered Plains. He is revealed to have been creating an Alethi economic center in the hills surrounding the Shattered Plains, rather than focusing on winning gemhearts.\r\nSebarial was one of only three highprinces to, quite unexpectedly, accompany Dalinar to the center of the Shattered Plains to assault the Parshendi and locate the Oathgate. Sebarial and his mistress, Palona, traveled in a carriage for the war procession."
