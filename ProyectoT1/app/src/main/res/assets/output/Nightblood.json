    "characterDescription": "Nightblood is an Awakened sword, native to the world of Nalthis and formerly wielded by Vasher, now Zahel. Nightblood was an attempt to make a Shardblade using a different magic that turned out poorly.* In fact, according to Brandon, Nightblood is kind of a mismade, evil Shardblade, but more mismade than evil.\r\nNightblood was later given to Szeth by Nale."
