    "characterDescription": "Noromin was a lieutenant in the Wall Guard of Kholinar. He commanded Platoon Seven, Squad Two, and was called Noro by his men.\r\nHe had found Kaladin and named him a deserter, indicating to his men that the newcomer had a shash brand - an ugly one, Sadeas's mark ... and on a lighteyes, no less.\r\nHe later asked Kaladin about the brand, to which Kaladin responded that he had a squabble with Amaram.\r\nNoromin knew that one could not just brand a lighteyed man a slave. That one needed the permission of a highprince. Thus, he knew that there was more to Kaladin's story.\r\nWith regard to Kaladin joining the Wall Guard, Noro dropped very obvious hints for him. Reminders of how well-fed the men of the barracks are, of how good it is to be part of a squad, etc..\r\nLater, he told Kaladin to keep his head; he suspected that Kaladin would end up as squadleader before too long. Then, he told him not to run too fast toward danger.\r\nNoro really wanted him promoted to lieutenant.\r\nOnce the Voidbringers begin their attack on the wall in Kholinar, Kaladin tells Noro that he has control of squads Three and Four of the Wall Guard.\r\nNoro's squad survives the attack, but others don't.\r\nNoro killed Sah during the Voidbringer assault on Kholinar, and was then killed by Khen in turn."
