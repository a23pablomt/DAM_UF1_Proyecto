    "characterDescription": "Thanadal is a Highprince of Alethkar.\r\nWhile not a Shardbearer himself, he relies on Brightlord Resi, (the only full  Shardbearer under his command) to do most of the direct fighting.\r\nThanadal was one of the Highprinces of Alethkar to harshly refuse Dalinar Kholin's offer of a joint assault of a plateau. He later vocally provoked Adolin into a duel against Brightlord Resi, though not for the Shards involved. After Adolin won the duel, very little was heard from him until the convention of the Highprinces after the assassination attempt on Elhokar's life at the hands of the Assassin in White."
