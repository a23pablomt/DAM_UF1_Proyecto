    "characterDescription": "Eth is a former member of Bridge Four who became a member of the King's Guard. He was paired with his brother, Mart, by Kaladin to stay at King Elhokar's side in effort to protect Elhokar during an assassination attempt at the Pinnacle.\r\nEth tended the wounds of Dalinar and Adolin once the threat of the Assassin in White had passed. (Eth had been trained by Kaladin in basic field medicine.) Afterward, he was commended by the king for his quick responses.\r\nAfter Dalinar was attacked yet again by Szeth, Eth clutched his now dead brother's body, weeping.\r\nLater, as Kaladin is training members of Bridge Four to absorb Stormlight in order to become his Windrunner squires, Eth accidentally sticks a stone to his hand.\r\nWhen Rock boils water with cremlings in it, then serves it, Eth spurts out his mouthful of drink, indicating to Rock that it is like the creatures' bathwater."
