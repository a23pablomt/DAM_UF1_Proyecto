    "characterDescription": "Odium is one of the sixteen Shards of Adonalsium. He was originally held by Rayse and was - for a time - one of the three Shards located on Roshar, though he didn't start on Roshar.\r\nOdium is now trapped on Braize and has nine magic systems (i.e., Voidbindings).\r\nOdium's name is first spoken in a vision had by Kaladin. He later asks Syl if she had heard the name, and she hisses and flies off, the name obviously greatly distressing her.\r\nIn a vision given to Dalinar, it is revealed that Odium had killed the Almighty, although his means in so doing remain unclear. His reason, however, is his ultimate goal: to become the most powerful entity in the cosmere."
