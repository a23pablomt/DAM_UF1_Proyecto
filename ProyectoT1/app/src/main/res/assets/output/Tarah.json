    "characterDescription": "Tarah is somewhat of a mystery in Kaladin's past. It is assumed that she too is\/was an Alethi darkeyes. Kaladin referred to her as \u2018his first real romance.\u2019\r\nTarah coaxed Kaladin out of his single-minded determination in training with the spear due to his guilt over Tien's death. She claimed that it would burn him out.\r\nKaladin has referred to her some few times in The Way of Kings and in Words of Radiance.\r\nWhen Adolin speaks with Kaladin about Shallan, Kaladin's advice is for the heir to be frank with Shallan about his feelings. He then thinks about Tarah and the mistakes he made with her.\r\nLater, when Kaladin and Shallan are in the chasms and they are huddled together for warmth, he realises that this is the closest he's been physically to any woman since Tarah."
