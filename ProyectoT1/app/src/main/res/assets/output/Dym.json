    "characterDescription": "Dym is a soldier among Dalinar's elites of thirty-four years ago. He tosses a poleaxe to Dalinar so that he might finish off an enemy, which Dalinar then tosses back at him. After a gesture toward the dying man from Dalinar, Dym then rams a sword into the armored man's armpit, finishing the job.\r\nAfter noticing that Dalinar's sword, which had been handed to him by another soldier, had a chip in it the size of a thumb, and looked like it had been bent as well, Dym tells Dalinar that he was supposed to stick it into the squishy parts, not pound it against the hard parts.\r\nShortly thereafter, Dym asks Dalinar if he is all right, to which Dalinar replies that he'd never been better."
