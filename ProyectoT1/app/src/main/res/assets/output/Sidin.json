    "characterDescription": "Sidin is an Alethi captain of the Palace Guards in Kholinar.\r\nHis group was imprisoned at the order of Queen Aesudan during the corruption of Kholinar. They were subsequently freed from confinement by Adolin, joining his group in their attempt to take back the palace and the city.\r\nHowever, Adolin told Sidin that his men would be reserves. Conversely, Sidin told Adolin that if he was storming the palace, he and his men would join him.\r\nFurther, Sidin told Adolin that something was wrong with the queen. That she killed an ardent (i.e., Pai) and then executed Brightlord Kaves. That he and his men were now traitors."
