    "characterDescription": "Ithi is an ardent that Highmarshal Azure keeps busy providing food for the people of Kholinar with a Soulcaster from within a room in the palace that has been lined with sheets of a strange metal provided to the Wall Guard by Wit. This metal prevents the screamers from recognizing that Soulcasting is occurring, and thereby alerting the Fused to it.\r\nAzure tells Kaladin that they keep poor Ithi and her sister working nonstop, trading off the Soulcaster. Further, that feeding the entire city would be an impossible task for the two of them, but they've been able to at least keep their army strong, with some to spare."
