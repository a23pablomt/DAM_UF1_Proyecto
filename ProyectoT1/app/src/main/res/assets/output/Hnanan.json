    "characterDescription": "Hnanan is the equivalent of a highprince. Her name isn't fully a word, more a hummed sound, with specific beats.\r\nShe tells Moash that Odium has a command for him, which is rare for a human. She tells him that he has killed a king, and asks him if he would do the same to a god.\r\nAs she did so, she removed a strange knife from within a sheath and gave it to him, with which he then killed Jezrien."
