    "characterDescription": "Teft's parents were members of the Envisagers. They believed in the Immortal Words (the Ideals), the Knights Radiant, the Almighty, and especially old Vorinism. They also believed that they had the power of the Radiants within them and that if they were about to die, the power would come out in them and they would save themselves. Thus, many of them died, quite unnecessarily. Teft believes that they are all dead because of something he did. He believes that there might be others who are still alive but does not know how to find them.\r\n"
