    "characterDescription": "Rayse was the Shardholder of the Shard of Adonalsium, Odium, who was - for a time - one of the three Shards located on Roshar.\r\nAt some point in the past, Rayse made a pact with Cephandrius (i.e., Hoid) which (presumptuously) prohibited the god from inflicting upon Cephandrius any type of pain. This oath bound not only the Vessel, but the Shard itself.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\nRayse benefitted from Odium's intent inasmuch as Odium was described as loathsome, crafty, and dangerous. Rayse wanted to become what he was."
