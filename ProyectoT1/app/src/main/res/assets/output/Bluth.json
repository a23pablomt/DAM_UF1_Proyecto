    "characterDescription": "Bluth was a mercenary working for Tvlakv when Kaladin was enslaved. He wields a cudgel and threatens those men enslaved with it.\r\nHe was responsible for adjusting the sides of the wagon in which Kaladin was transported in order to expose him to the rain so that he might be clean when they arrived at their destination.\r\nWhen around commissioned troops, Bluth and Tag played their part, walking with their chests out and hands on their weapons. They shoved a few of the slaves into place, but stayed clear of Kaladin.\r\nHe also traveled with Shallan across the Shattered Plains in a caravan. After Bluth watched a company of deserters jog toward another caravan that was being attacked by bandits, he actually whooped and joined the deserters charging toward the battle.\r\nHe was killed while defending that other caravan. Shallan closed Bluth's eyes, not looking at the ripped-out hole in his torso, the bloody entrails.\r\nHowever, she noticed something poking out of his jacket. Stuffed in his pocket, was her picture of him. The one that depicted him not as he was, but as she imagined he might once have been. A soldier in an army, in a crisp uniform. Eyes forward, rather than looking down all the time. A hero."
