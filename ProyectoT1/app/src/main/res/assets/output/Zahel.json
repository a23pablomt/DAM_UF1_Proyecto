    "characterDescription": "Zahel is an ardent, yet a reclusive warrior who taught both Adolin and Renarin - plus Kaladin - how to use a Shardblade, and was also Azure's swordmaster. He is the Worldhopper, Vasher, from Nalthis.\r\nHe went to Roshar because he knew ahead of time, that one could get Stormlight (i.e., Investiture) there, and how easy it was. So he made his way there because he was tired of sucking people's souls to stay alive."
