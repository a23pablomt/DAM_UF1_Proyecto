    "characterDescription": "Toh is the brother of Evi who negotiates the terms of her betrothal to Dalinar, with regard to her transference of the Shardplate they possess in exchange for both their protection from their own people.\r\nStill, despite that he does so, he and she both delay a painfully long time to even agree to the betrothal.\r\nYet, Toh is responsible for delivering to Dalinar the news that Evi had gone into labor with their first child.\r\nThat said, Dalinar has since not seen Toh in a decade. Toh went to Herdaz and reportedly liked it quite well, living on the coast, protected by Alethi bodyguards."
