    "characterDescription": "Navani Kholin, the Queen Mother, is the widow of Gavilar, and mother of Jasnah and Elhokar. She had been courted by both Gavilar and Dalinar once, but she chose Gavilar, not because he would be king, but because she was frightened of Dalinar.\r\nShe is politically adept and is an engineer and researcher of fabrials. She had been in Kholinar to aid Queen Aesudan in protecting the interests of the queen's husband (then, King Elhokar), but felt sidelined and useless there. She ventured to the Shattered Plains to protect her son, to bring word that the Vedens had perfected what they called half-Shards, and to pursue Dalinar.\u00a0"
