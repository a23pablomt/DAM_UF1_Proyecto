    "characterDescription": "Khriss is one of the lead characters in the original, unpublished White Sand. She's a scholar who stumbles upon a much larger universe than she had bargained for. She is the most knowledgeable individual about just what is going on in the cosmere; more than Hoid, more than Nazh. Khriss concerns herself only with the workings of Investiture and the finer details of each world's magic system.\r\nKhriss is also the employer of Nazh. She is from the world Taldain, and has spent a good portion of her life on the Dayside there, although she's from the Darkside.."
