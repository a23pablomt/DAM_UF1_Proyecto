    "characterDescription": "Gavinor Kholin is the three-year-old son of Elhokar and Aesudan Kholin. As his mother is now compromised, having bonded with the Unmade, Yelig-nar, Elhokar whisks his son away from her in effort to leave with him from the palace in Kholinar. Thus, Gavinor was being carried by his father while on task to open the Honor Gate, yet Elhokar was assassinated by Moash who impaled him with a spear through the chest, then through the eye. Gavinor was then carried away by one of the Queen's Guard.\r\nLater, after Kholinar has been lost and the fight for Thaylen City concluded, Kaladin seeks out the merchant who still possesses a spanreed amongst groups of refugees along the coast of Alethkar. He comes upon one such group with the symbol for Bridge Four painted on a tarp. There, he finds Skar and Drehy. Skar tells him there was something they didn't reveal via spanreed; Drehy presents him with Gavinor, his lips chapped and his eyes haunted.\r\nGavinor is now heir to the Alethi throne, but when Adolin mentions the succession, Dalinar states that the boy is too young and that this is no time for a regency. Dalinar suggests to Adolin that Gavinor can be named his heir, assuming his son will take the throne and secure the monarchy. Adolin states emphatically that he will not be king. Whatever the child's future remains as yet to be determined.\r\nThat said, Dalinar plays with his grandnephew and shows him how to hold his practice sword, now a child of not yet five."
