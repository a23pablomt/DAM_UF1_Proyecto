    "characterDescription": "The tattooist is a calm, sturdy darkeyed woman.\r\nThe rest of Bridge Four stands around Hobber in the tent, watching in silence as the tattooist works carefully on his forehead, covering up the scar of his slave's brand with the glyphs Kaladin had provided.\r\nOnce the process is finished, the tattooist provides a mirror for Hobber to look into. When he indicates that it's not enough, she settles down on her stool again and begins adding the Bridge Four glyphs to Hobber's forehead, tucked below the freedom glyph now there. She spends the process explaining - again - how the tattoo will be sore for days and how Hobber will need to care for it.\r\nShe then applies the same glyphs to Skar's, Rock's, Beld's, and Teft's foreheads, but when Shen steps forward, she says that she can't tattoo him because he's property.\r\nTeft quickly interjects that Shen has been freed like the rest of them, yet Hobber goes one step further, telling her to give him the tattoo, or she won't see a sphere in payment.\r\nThe tattoo artist finally sighs and gives in. She pulls her stool over and begins working on Shen's forehead, grumbling that they won't even be able to see it, though Sigzil's skin is nearly as dark as that of Shen, and the tattoo had shown up fine on him."
