    "characterDescription": "Colot is a lighteyed captain who led soldiers to the chamber where the body of Vedekar Perel was found.\r\nHe's an archer in the Fifth Battalion of the Alethi army.\r\nWhen Dalinar inquires of him whether they have him scouting the tower of Urithiru with Bridge Four, Colot replies that the Windrunners needed extra feet and access to more scouts and scribes for maps. He tells Dalinar that his archers are mobile, and that he figured it was better than doing parade drills in the cold, so he volunteered his company. When Dalinar asks him who his policing force was, Colot tells him that it was Eighth Company and Captain Tallan, but that Tallan hadn't made it. Dalinar tells Colot that he's sorry, but then asks that he and his men withdraw and maintain that perimeter until he tells him otherwise, but to inform King Elhokar of the situation and send a messenger to Sebarial. Colot's soldiers then leave, including the bridgemen."
