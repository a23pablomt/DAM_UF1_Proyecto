    "characterDescription": "Rock was a bridgeman in Sadeas's army. He became Bridge Four's cook and barber. He is an Unkalaki, or Horneater, whose full name is actually Numuhukumakiaki'aialunamor. This name is a description of a type of rock his father found shortly before he was born. The name is hard to pronounce, which is why people simply call him \"Rock\". He is called Lunamor amongst his family members.\r\nHe is married and has sent letters to his family via spanreed to the Horneater Peaks message station, paid for by his first saved wages, though the Peaks are so far away that news of them has not yet returned. That is, not until he and his fellows follow a plume of smoke on the Shattered Plains and find a ransacked and raided caravan there. Rock is overjoyed to find that his family is there."
