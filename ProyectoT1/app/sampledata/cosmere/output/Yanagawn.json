    "characterDescription": "Yanagawn is the name of the current Prime Aqasix of Azir, First of his name, emperor of all Makabak. He is also commonly known as Gawx by Lift.\r\nLift tells Ghenna that those in Azir (likely referring to the viziers) in the Bronze Palace) changed his name ... that Gawx is kind of a dumb name ... and one doesn't want one's emperor to sound dumb, but that one can't stop that if he starts talking.\r\nNow known as Prime Aqasix Yanagawn the First, emperor of all Makabak, Gawx is no longer embarrassed while talking to the viziers and scions of Azir. He understands much of what they discuss now, and doesn't jump when someone calls him \"Your Majesty.\" Remarkably, he has started to forget that he'd ever been a frightened thief sneaking through the palace."
