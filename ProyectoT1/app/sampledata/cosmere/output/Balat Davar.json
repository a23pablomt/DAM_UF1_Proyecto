    "characterDescription": "Balat Davar, or Nan Balat, is the second son of Brightlord Lin Davar, younger brother to Helaran, and older brother to Asha Jushu, Tet Wikim, and Shallan. He is married to Eylita.\r\nThe term Nan appears to be a title for the oldest son, since - before his death or disappearance - his older brother, Helaran, was titled Nan. He and his sister were largely exempt from his father's brutal temper, as his older and younger brothers were not.\r\nAt only 23-years-old, Nan Balat suffers from an injury to his leg - caused by his father - that left him with a limp and constant pain. The break had been bad, and the surgeon had nearly decided to cut off the entire leg. Perhaps he could be thankful that hadn't proven necessary.\r\nHe enjoys the act of killing small animals such as cremlings. He has been raising axehounds since he was young. After exchanging letters (presumably romantic ones) with Eylita, Balat's sadistic tendencies wane. Shallan attributes his change of heart to his blossoming romance with Eylita.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\n"
