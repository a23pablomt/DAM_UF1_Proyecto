    "characterDescription": "Elhokar Kholin was King of Alethkar, son of former King Gavilar and former Queen Navani, and younger brother of now Queen Jasnah.\u00a0He was 27 years of age and a Shardbearer;\u00a0his Shardblade is called Sunraiser. His Shardplate gleams golden.. Unlike his uncle, Dalinar, and cousin, Adolin, Elhokar did not ride a\u00a0Ryshadium, although he did ride one of the best horses among Shin stock named Vengeance.\r\nWhile he was the Alethi king, he was absent from his kingdom and held his court on the borders of the Shattered Plains, along with ten highprinces, at war with the Parshendi\u00a0and seeking to fulfill the Vengeance Pact. However, he stood aloof from fighting personally in the war, as was appropriate.\r\nAs long as Elhokar ruled, the highprinces got to fight in the war their way and fatten their purses. He didn't make many demands of them. They liked having him as their king."
