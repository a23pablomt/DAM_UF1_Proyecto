    "characterDescription": "Azure is Highmarshal of the Wall Guard in Kholinar. She has no commander above her, not even Queen Aesudan Kholin. She joined the Wall Guard because she thought they would have information on Vasher.\r\nYokska tells Elhokar that she hasn't seen him; that \nhe doesn't come down from the wall much. Kaladin suspects that Azure is the one responsible for feeding the city, for providing grain to the people.\r\nAccording to Beard, he does rounds every night around dinner time, checking on each barracks.\r\nMembers of the  Wall Guard refer to Highmarshal Azure as \"he\" and \"him\" because women are not warriors in Vorin society. Still, they find her to be incredible; when they lost their former commander, she led a group who held the wall when the Cult of Moments tried to seize the city gates, fighting like a Voidbringer, holding aloft a gleaming Shardblade.\r\nThe first thing that Azure did when she took command was to have the Wall Guard attack the low monastery, by the eastern gates, in order to get the only Soulcaster that wasn't in the palace. She tells them that they have to close their ears to voices coming from the palace. That they can't be taken by them unless they listen.\r\nAzure is curious about Kaladin, the lighteyed man with slave brands. She asks him how he is finding his time in the Wall Guard, to which he replies that it's a well-run army. Stating that he has a regal name, she also asks him what his house is, to which he replies that they just call him Stormblessed.\r\nShe is excited to learn from him of the Oathgate at the palace and wants to get it started and working to save the people of the city.\r\nUnfortunately, Azure also learns that reinforcing troops await the other side of the Oathgate. She and the Wall Guard join in the assault on the palace. After a minor victory, Adolin notices that Azure has removed her cloak and wrapped it half around her left arm. He'd never seen anything like it, and thought that perhaps she was accustomed to fighting in Plate.\r\nAll too soon, the booby-trapped Oathgate drops Azure, Shallan, Kaladin, and Adolin into Shadesmar.\r\nAzure says, \"Damnation.  I hate this place.\"  She tells her companions that she is from a far land and that she came to Roshar about a year ago, hunting a man, a criminal. She used a portal between realms - Cultivation's perpendicularity in the Horneater Peaks.  She had spren guides and traveled by a ship sailed by spren.\r\nWhen Adolin asks if she is a Knight Radiant or a Herald, Azure replies, \"I'm just a woman who has been constantly out of her league since adolescence.\"  When Adolin and Kaladin look skeptical, Azure says, \"Really. There's no spren here for my Blade because it's flawed. I can't summon or dismiss it. She's ... but a pale copy of what you carry.\"\r\nAfter an encounter in Shadesmar with the lighthouse keeper, Riino, Azure tells Kaladin that charlatans like him aren't uncommon where she comes from (i.e., people who claim to be able to see the future, living off the hopes of others). Further, she says that Kaladin's society was right to forbid them. That the spren do likewise, so Riino's kind have to live in places like Shadesmar, hoping people will be desperate enough to come to them. Probably getting some business with each ship that comes through there.\r\nHowever, he tells Azure that he saw something, and that it was real. She responds with the following:"
