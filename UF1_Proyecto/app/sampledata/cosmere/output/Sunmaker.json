    "characterDescription": "Sunmaker was the last Alethi king before Gavilar to unite the highprinces (about 500 years ago). He began his quest to do so at the age of seventeen, and was responsible for casting down the Hierocracy. He inspired Gavilar, who revered him, but who hoped his own accomplishments wouldn't be as ephemeral as those of Sunmaker."
