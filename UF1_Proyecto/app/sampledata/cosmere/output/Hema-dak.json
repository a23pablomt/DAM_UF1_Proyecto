Puuli helped her by watching her children so she could run a broth to her sister, who was sick with the fever, after the Everstorm had past through their little port on the crumbling eastern edge of Roshar. Puuli also told Hema-dak that the storm was truly tragic, even as he is secretly happy about it."
