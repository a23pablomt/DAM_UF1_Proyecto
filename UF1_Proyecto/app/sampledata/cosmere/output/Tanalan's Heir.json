    "characterDescription": "Tanalan's heir was remembered by Dalinar as having been a weeping child holding a Shardblade after he'd killed Tanalan, who lay broken and dead, the child's soft voice pleading.\r\nWhen Gavilar reminded Dalinar that he said he'd dealt with the heir, and asked him about having supposedly done so, Dalinar told his brother that the heir was then a child.\r\nGavilar replied that the heir was still a descendant of the old regime and was old enough to be a threat.\r\nDalinar replied that he could then barely lift the Blade, so he gave the child to his mother, whom he told to hide the boy.\r\nAccording to Gavilar, the Rifters had later demanded Dalinar's Blade back, claiming that Tanalan's heir had returned, and that he deserved the Blade, as Dalinar had never won it in a true contest.\r\nAccording to Havar, rumor had it that the Rifters wanted to set up their own highprince in Tanalan's heir, also named Tanalan."
