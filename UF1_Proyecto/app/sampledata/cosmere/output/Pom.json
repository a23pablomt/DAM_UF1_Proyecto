    "characterDescription": "Pom is Mem's new assistant laundress.\r\nAccording to Mem, women like Pom didn't usually end up as washgirls.\r\nWhile Pom dallies once she and Mem are inside Mraize's home, she then freezes in the doorway to his den.\r\nShe then destroys one of Mraize's paintings,* ripping through it with a knife, declaring that she'd been looking for it.\r\nWhen Mraize appears, Pom narrows her eyes at him and pushes him aside. When he tells her that he knows where Talenelat is, she freezes.\r\nFurther, he tells her that his babsk (i.e., Iyatil) has been eager to speak with her."
