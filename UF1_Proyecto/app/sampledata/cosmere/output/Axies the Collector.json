    "characterDescription": "Axies is a scholar who has made it his life's work to observe, catalogue, and study every single type of spren on Roshar. He often writes his notes on his body because he's regularly robbed of everything he owns, including his clothing. (If he didn't write on himself, he'd lose his notes.) In The Way of Kings, he awakens in an alleyway in Kasitor, a large Iriali city, second in size only to Rall Ellorim.\r\nWhile intoxicated, Axies attempted to confirm the existence of alespren, sudspren or intoxicationspren ... a type of spren rumored to appear when one is heavily under the influence, but that appeared only infrequently in Iri. Having been robbed of everything (including his clothing), he'd been arrested and escorted to jail, where he hoped to observe captivityspren.\r\nAfter being released from jail - or escaping from it (Axies did not discover the captivityspren while he was held) - he made his way to the docks in order to study the strange silver spren that inhabit the larger crustaceans of Roshar. He drew his share of stares. Once Axies arrived, he quickly got the attention of the local population. Even so, he found a place to stand, adjusted his blanket around him, and eventually watched as the immense spren, Cusicesh the Protector, emerged from the water.\r\nDespite that, he was soon rendered naked - yet again - by a street urchin who scrabbled past him and grabbed his wrap from him, Axies remained pleased that he'd have yet another opportunity to seek captivityspren while incarcerated."
