    "characterDescription": "Kishi is the name that Kharat gives to Veil when she first approaches the Revel. It means Mystery.\r\nAfter Kishi passes Kharat in a hallway, she joins the revel outside. A man there laughs and grabs at her safehand, as if to pull her toward one of the rooms. Kishi dodges him and slips farther inward, flowing through the stream of people. To her, the outer ring seems to round the entire Oathgate platform.\r\nThe secrets were farther toward the center. Nobody forbade her as she left the flow of the outer ring, stepping between two buildings, heading inward.\r\nThe next ring inward on the Oathgate platform was filled with people crawling. Kishi stood at the perimeter, watching a multitude of men and women in ragged finery crawl past her, giggling, moaning, or gasping. Each seemed in the thrall of a different emotion, and each stared with an openly maddened expression. She thought she recognized a few from the descriptions of lighteyes who had disappeared into the palace, though in their state, it was hard to tell.\r\nKishi wavered at the edge of the ring, thinking she should've kept to the outer ring; she didn't belong there. There was food aplenty behind her. Laughter and reveling. It seemed to pull her back, inviting her to join the eternal, beautiful walk.\r\nWithin that ring, time wouldn't matter. She could forget Shallan, and what she'd done. Just give in.\r\nPattern hummed, Veil gasped, and let Kishi burst from her, Lightweaving collapsing. She had to be away from this place. It was doing things to her brain. Strange things, even for her."
