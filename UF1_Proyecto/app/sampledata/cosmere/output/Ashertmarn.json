    "characterDescription": "Ashertmarn is one of the Unmade, a mysterious group of odious spren on Roshar. Also known as the Heart of the Revel, his influence leads people to excessive indulgence, which eventually leads to mindless excess, as is evidenced by members of the Cult of Moments that Shallan observes upon her entrance to the revel upon the Oathgate platform in Kholinar.\r\nUpon her inspection of the control building of the Oathgate there, Shallan found instead an inhumanly shaped heart.\r\nAshertmarn was last heard by Shallan, who spoke to her."
