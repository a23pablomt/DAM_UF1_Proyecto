    "characterDescription": "Lift is a thief of Reshi descent, who grew up in Rall Elorim. She is currently an unofficial advisor to the Azish Prime Aqasix. Through her bond with the Cultivationspren, Wyndle, she is afforded the powers of an Edgedancer, or the Surges of Abrasion and Progression. It is implied that she spoke the First Ideal of the Knights Radiant when she 'captured' Wyndle.\r\nWyndle frequently complains that he was 'told' to bond Lift, while his preference is for a person of importance. The Ring instructed Wyndle to bond with Lift as she had visited the Nightwatcher and received a boon."
