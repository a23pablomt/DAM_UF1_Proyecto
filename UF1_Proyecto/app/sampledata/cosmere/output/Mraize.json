    "characterDescription": "Mraize is a member of the Ghostbloods who appears, at first, to be a leader within the organization. (It is later revealed by Iyatil that he is her student.)\r\nHe is pursued by Shallan, who hopes to infiltrate the secret society, due to both her father's and Brother Kabsal's involvement within it. Mraize tests Shallan (as Veil, by which name she chooses to be known within his circle of influence) by setting her to the task (supposedly, through her mistress, Tyn) of breaking into Amaram's manor to investigate therein and learn his hidden secrets.\r\nLater, when Mraize inspects his Azish cavalrylord's suit, he tells his laundress Mem that she is a genius in having removed the aether from it. As he has already accurately identified her new laundry assistant (i.e., Pom) as Shalash, he then tells Mem that she'll now have to find a new wash-girl."
