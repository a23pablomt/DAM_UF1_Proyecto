    "characterDescription": "Rine Hatham is a highprince of Alethkar. His princedom lies on Alethkar's western border. His wife makes the Dawncities her study.\r\nFollowing the formation of the Vengeance Pact, Hatham traveled with his army to the Shattered Plains. He belives that \"money is behind every war\" and, coincidentally, he was well behind in his payments to King Elhokar, which was one of the many acts of the highprinces that undermined King Elhokar's rule.\r\nHatham involved ardents in his political maneuvers, an act which was both illegal and a violation of custom ever since the Hierocracy. However, the tactic became increasingly popular and was used by many lighteyes.\r\nWhile three of the highprinces joined Dalinar on his expedition to the center of the Shattered Plains, the greater number had remained behind. When the unexpected highstorm came, Hatham had received word via spanreed from scouts out along the Plains. His warcamp had been able to get out most of their spheres for recharging before the storm hit, giving him a huge amount of Stormlight compared to the rest of them. He was becoming a wealthy man as Dalinar traded for infused spheres to work the Oathgate and bring in supplies."
