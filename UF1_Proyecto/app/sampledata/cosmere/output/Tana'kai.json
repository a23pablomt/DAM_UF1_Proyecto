    "characterDescription": "Tana'kai is like a king, according to Rock, but more. He tells a story about how tana'kai went to the gods to plead for help. These gods are actually spren. Still, Rock says, some are more powerful than others. The tana'kai sought the strongest among them. He went first to the gods of the trees, but they could not hide his people. Next, tana'kai visited the gods of the waters, but they could not help either.\r\nLast, tana'kai - desperate - visited the most powerful of gods, the gods of the mountains. The gods of the mountains thought long on his request to live there where they resided.  They replied that theirs was a place of spirits, not of men, but that if he could find way to make it a place of men and of spirits, they would protect him and his people. Tana'kai found those ways and so the Unkalaki people would live upon the mountains of the Horneater Peaks from there on."
