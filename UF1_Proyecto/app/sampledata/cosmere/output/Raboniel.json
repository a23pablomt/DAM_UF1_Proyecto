    "characterDescription": "Raboniel was the Fused that led the invasion of Urithiru because she believed the Sibling was a deadeye. She is called the \"Lady of Wishes\" by the Nine, but the Sibling calls her \"The Lady of Pains\" as she was originally known thousands of years ago. Raboniel forces Navani to refer to her as the \"Ancient One.\""
