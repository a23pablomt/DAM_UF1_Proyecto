    "characterDescription": "Dukar is the head of King Taravangian's Testers. According to Taravangian, with regard to the king having to prove himself not to be an idiot on a daily basis, Dukar let the prohibitions instituted by his idiot self control his true self when it finally had the opportunity to emerge.\r\nIn one instance, Dukar declares Taravangian to be smart, but almost to the danger line. Still, he reluctantly agrees that the king can interact, and make policy decisions, and that he needs no restrictions.\r\nIn a much later instance, Dukar takes a paper, looks it over, and determines Taravangian to be stupid.\r\nHe announces to Mrall that Taravangian is weak of mind that day. That he can interact, but shouldn't make important policy decisions. Further, that they cannot trust his interpretation of the Diagram."
