    "characterDescription": "Kalak is one of the ten Heralds of the Almighty. He is associated with the number Kak, the essence Foil and the divine attributes Resolute and Builder. He is assumed to have founded - and to be the patron Herald of - the order of Knights Radiant known as Willshapers.\r\nHe was later known as Kelek - as he is still known in modern Alethkar - due to a vowel shift in the language between time periods.\r\nHis name is a favored curse word for Teft.\r\nIn Rhythm of War, Kelek is the High Judge of the honorspren in Shadesmar. He presides over Adolin's trial. He says Adolin isn't a smart one for offering to be tried for the Recreance. He tells Adolin that Tanavast is completely dead and that this world is doomed as it belongs to Odium now.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\nKelek complains to his Honorspen assistant that they even let Adolin into Lasting Integrity. He also complains after years of joining the honorspren they still don't have a way for him to get off this cursed world.[citation\u00a0needed]"
