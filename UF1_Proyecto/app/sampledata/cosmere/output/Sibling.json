    "characterDescription": "The Sibling is the third of three super-spren - akin to the Stormfather and the Nightwatcher - associated with the order of Knights Radiant known as Bondsmiths. They have gone into hiding for reasons unknown.\r\nA series of related records left by an Elsecaller in Urithiru's library drawers of the gem archive there, link the Sibling to the health of the tower city. The entries relate the decline of the tower's functionality (particularly with respect to habitation failures) and to the withdrawal of the Sibling. The author argues that the spren's disappearance was neither intentional nor a result of internal strife amongst the Knights Radiant."
