    "characterDescription": "Mik's mother drops a large child off at Tashi's Light Orphanage, because, according to Lift, people left children at orphanages who were too big to keep caring for, but couldn't take care of themselves or contribute to the family.\r\nLift observes that she sniffles audibly, holding the hand of the child, then leads him to the doorstep of the orphanage, and pulls him into a hug. She bows her head, then her back, and slinks away, leaving the boy."
