    "characterDescription": "Arclo initially appears as an old man on the stone benches outside Tashi's Light Orphanage in Yeddaw, Tashikk. \"He\" tells Lift not to judge the woman who runs the orphanage too harshly. He says they call her the Stump, because she won't be blown by any storm. He tells her how to get on the Stump's good side, which Lift thinks is lame, as is, in her opinion, the man's question that follows. She gives him what she thinks is a lame answer. He replies that it was an honest one.\r\nLift finds him again much later in an alleyway. He tells her that he's spent thousands of years breeding his hordelings (i.e., specifically purposed cremlings), but that he still can't make them fit together quite right. He says he can pass for human almost as well as a Siah Aimian, but that anyone who looks closely at him finds something off. To him, this is rather frustrating.\r\nLift asks him what he knows about Darkness and his plans ... and Radiants, and Voidbringers, and everything.\r\nArclo replies that he is the wrong one to ask; that his siblings are more interested than he in Radiants. He then names his siblings and himself as the Sleepless.\r\nShe doesn't like his response, telling him it's not the kind she wanted. He replies that he is not here to answer her. That he is here because he's interested, and that she is the source of his curiosity. He then claims to have achieved immortality, and that, as a result, he must find a purpose beyond the struggle to live, as old Axies always did.\r\nAs Lift retreats, he says he's building a philosophy meaningful enough to span ages. Further, that he can grow what he needs. That if his mind becomes full, he can breed new hordelings specialized in holding memories. That if he needs to sense what is going on in the city, he can breed hordelings with extra eyes, or antennae to taste and hear. Given time, he can make for his body nearly anything he needs.\r\nHe states that each person is but a piece of something larger - some greater organism that makes up the city, not unlike the hordelings that make up his kind.\r\nWhen asked by Lift whether he's still creepy, Arclo replies that he's the man he was made to be. When asked what the secret to being human is, he replies that he doesn't think that he knows, at least not better than she does.\r\nWhen she finds him alive in an alley as the Everstorm is upon them, he is spouting philosophy. She accuses him of killing Nale's underlings, to which he replies that they asked for a contest and he gave it to them.\r\nAs she sees that of which he is comprised, she questions what he is. He claims to be just another refugee, that she needn't fear him, that ancient Radiants named him friend and ally before everything went wrong. Before the Last Desolation. Days of honor now long gone."
