    "characterDescription": "The dock registrar in Celebrant tells team Shallan that there are no ships sailing toward the Horneater Peaks or toward Thaylen City. That those destinations are too close to enemy holdings.\r\nHe also mentions that an official inspection of ships happens at the first hour every day, and that they usually only take thirteen minutes.\r\nAfter having observed that one of the Fused presides over ship inspections, Shallan accosts the registrar, asking him how he couldn't have mentioned that Voidspren rule the city. The registrar responds that he thought everyone knew.\r\nHe tells her that anger isn't helpful. That he's a professional. That it's not his job to explain to her things that she should already know.\r\nWhen Shallan asks him when it happened, he says that it's been months now. Still, he tells her that they don't have firm control. That it's just a few officials, and promises from their leaders are to follow. That Fused check in on them now and then. Further, that he thinks the other one (i.e., Kyril) is quite insane.\r\nHowever, when team Shallan hides from the Fused in the registrar's building, Shallan having illusorily disguised them all as the sailors she'd sketched, the Fused bursts in and finds them cringing. Still, he approaches the registrar, accusing him of knowing that Ico's ship was harboring criminals. The registrar cringes down by the desk and tells the Fused that they'd gone to the market for needed supplies. That they'd asked him for ships that would get them passage to the Perpendicularity.\r\nThe Fused then directs the registrar to put the fire on Ico's ship out. The registrar refers to the Fused as great one, but is told that when he's finished putting out the fire, he must clear his things from his office, and that he's to be replaced immediately.\r\nAfter the Fused charges out of the room, the registrar looks to team Shallan, gloriously identifying them as Radiants, telling Shallan that those amongst the spren have waited so long for the honor of men to return, and that they must depart on a ship. He tells them that he'll stall, but that they should go quickly."
