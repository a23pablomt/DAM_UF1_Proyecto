    "characterDescription": "Teleb was a lighteyed officer and Shardbearer in Dalinar's warcamp on Roshar. He was the highlord on duty who reported a chasmfiend attack to Dalinar.\r\nHe had suggested using lighter, more portable bridges to get across early chasms on the Shattered Plains, then resort to siege bridges only for the final assault.\r\nHe was also the highlord who escorted the prisoner, Rlain, into Dalinar's presence once Rlain had turned himself over to the Alethi. (Teleb later released Rlain, at Dalinar's instruction, into the custody of Bridge Four.)\r\nTeleb was killed during the battle of Narak. His Shardblade was recovered by Captain Khal."
