    "characterDescription": "Lhan is a senior ardent assigned to mentor Sister Pai in the ardentia of the then Queen, Aesudan Kholin. He is easily distracted by the trappings of his surroundings, but sincerely believes in his duty to serve the Queen. He even goes so far as to express that such service is easy.\r\nLhan is rather condescending, caught up in his own importance and in his belief of his Queen's privilege as the Almighty's chosen. Still, he avoids things like composing poems for his Queen because it seems like work.\r\nHe considers himself to be one of the Queen's chosen (as he believes all of her many ardents to be); those who enjoy the luxuries of warm baths, horseback riding using her stables, music, art, massages, etc..\r\nHe was horrified by the action his mentee (Pai) took which lead to the Kholinar riots."
