    "characterDescription": "Roion was a highprince of Alethkar. He had great archers, superior to those of the other highprinces. However, he won the fewest gemhearts of all of the highprinces.\r\nRoion was one of only three highprinces to, quite unexpectedly, accompany Dalinar to the center of the Shattered Plains to assault the Parshendi and locate the Oathgate.\r\nWhen Dalinar was attacked by Szeth near the center of the Shattered Plains, Roion attempted to defend him and was lashed to a point in the sky by Szeth. He later plummeted from the sky and and hit the ground with a sickening crunch. Roion was pronounced dead by Dalinar, stating that he fell with honor."
