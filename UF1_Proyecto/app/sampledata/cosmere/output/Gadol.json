    "characterDescription": "Gadol was a bridgeman in Bridge Four. During a bridge run, he suffered a deep wound in his side where an arrow had passed completely through. With blood covering his face from a gash on his temple, he managed to crawl a short distance from the bridge. Looking up with frenzied black eyes, orange painspren wave around him.\r\nKaladin dragged Gadol to a cleft, trying to stanch the blood flow from his wound with his own hand. He then tore Gadol's shirt open, exposing the grim wound. Gadol spasmed, spit up blood, coughing, and uttered his final, haunting, last words."
