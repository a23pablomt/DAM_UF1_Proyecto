    "characterDescription": "Jochi is a scholar in Thaylen City who runs a pastry shop there. He is known to the world as a dynamic woman of distinctive philosophy, but is actually a pastry chef who's true name hasn't yet been revealed. (Jochi is his pen name.)\r\nHe is a friend of both Jasnah and Ethid and is also a Veristitalian. The three of them studied under the same master.\r\nWhen Jochi asks Jasnah via spanreed whether she is at Urithiru (post her supposed death) and when he can come visit her, she tells him just as soon as he's willing to let everyone know he isn't female.\r\nFurther, Jochi mentions that he thought his sighting of Axies the Collector was interesting.\r\nGrowing uncharacteristically solemn during the conversation, Jochi spoke directly of the state of Thaylenah, which had been hit hard by the repeated coming of the Everstorm; entire sections of Thaylen City were in ruin."
