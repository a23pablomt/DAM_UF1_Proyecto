    "characterDescription": "Brightlord Matal is the Alethi lighteyes in charge of the bridge crews. However, he leaves most of the day-to-day running of the crews up to his wife, Hashal.\r\nMatal requested the assignment as captain of the bridge crews because he believed that the crews were essential to Sadeas's advantage in the War of Reckoning. Hashal expressed that the mismanagement of the crews under Lamaril was disgraceful.\r\nAfter Dalinar and his army were abandoned at the battle of the Tower, Matal was vehement that Bridge Four cross Bridge Six's bridge and leave the staging plateau. At Kaladin's refusal, Matal realized that rather than continuing to insist, he'd prefer that Bridge Four be attacked and slaughtered by the Parshendi."
