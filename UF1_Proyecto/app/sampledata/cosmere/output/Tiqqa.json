    "characterDescription": "Tiqqa was an opportunist, a girl a few years Lift's senior, who swiped a whole basket of fruit from a shopkeeper in Yeddaw.\r\nShe bolted the moment she was spotted. She leaned down, clinging to the basket, then sprinted deftly through the crowd.\r\nNevertheless, Darkness snatched her from the crowd. She struggled, battering against him, though he remained stiff and didn't seem to notice or mind the attack. She grabbed a piece of fruit from the basket and threw it at him, bouncing it off his chest with a splat.\r\nShe then cringed before him, seemed to panic, reached to her belt, yanked out her knife and brandished it. She tried a desperate swing at his arm, but he easily slapped the weapon away with his empty hand.\r\nSeveral street urchins bet on on how long it would be before Tiqqa escaped \"this time.\"\r\nAs if in response to this, Darkness summoned his Shardblade and rammed it through the struggling girl's chest. It sank up to its hilt as he pulled her onto it, and she gasped, eyes going wide - then shriveling and burning out, twin trails of smoke creeping toward the sky.\r\nOnce Darkness left the scene, Lift forced her way to the fallen girl and attempted to reincorporate her, breathing out her \"awesomeness\", imparting it to the dead young woman.\r\nFor a moment, Lift saw a luminescence in the shape of a figure, vibrating around the corpse, quivering. Then, it puffed away, Tiqqa's body on the ground, her eyes burned.\r\nHer body didn't even bleed."
