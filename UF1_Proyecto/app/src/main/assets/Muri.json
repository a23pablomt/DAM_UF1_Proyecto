    "characterDescription": "Muri is a seamstress mentioned by Grund to Veil as someone worthy of a food distribution by her in Kholinar.\r\nAccording to Grund, she has lots of kids and has trouble feeding them. He says she has a hovel over by the old bakery that burned down on the first Evernight.\r\nAccording to Veil, Muri the seamstress proved to indeed be a woman with many children and little means of feeding them.\r\nShe lives in a packed tenement in a long room, and after Grund is killed by the Grips, Shallan seeks out a frightened Muri, who she finds hurriedly tossing clothing into a sack, her eldest daughter clutching a similar one.\r\nWhen Muri looks up, she sees Shallan - still looking like Veil - and curses to herself. To Shallan, her frown lines and scowl are unfamiliar because she'd always seemed so pleasant.\r\nWhen Shallan asks her whether she already knows about the fate of Grund, Muri says that all she knows is that the Grips are angry about something, and that she's not going to take a chance.\r\nShe also says that the one watching her met with another, and that they had a quiet argument, then took off. Further, that she heard her name, so she's leaving.\r\nShe then tells Shallan that they always had to sit there, waiting for her and her sack of goodies. Though Shallan apologizes, Muri leaves into the night with her children.",
