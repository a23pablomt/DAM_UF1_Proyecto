        "History": "Highprince Valam was a major combatant in Jah Keved's war of succession. \u00a0Although he was eventually able to defeat opposing factions and become the king of Jah Keved, succeeding Hanavanar, the city of Vedenar was torched and he became grievously ill. \u00a0When King Taravangian arrives after the final battle and has his doctors treat the wounded, the two kings meet. \u00a0Valam makes Taravangian his heir, and then orders his bastard son, Redin, to kill him so he can die an honorable death.\r\nUpon his death, a Shardblade appeared from vapor beside his bed, then thumped to the floor of the wagon in which he'd been transported. Nobody reached for it.",

This heritage caused Redin to be born dual-eyed, with one eye light and the other dark.\r\nThis description is so rare and is the apparent trait of a lighteye interbreeding with a darkeye. The condition is known as heterochromia.\r\nLighteyed Graves married a darkeyed woman and had a son with her who displays the same condition.",
