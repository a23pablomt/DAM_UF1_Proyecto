        "Biography": "With her father, Vai escaped from a village near Hearthstone when the Everstorm first passed, and joined a group led by the singer Khen and the Voidspren Yixli bound for Revolar.\r\nWhen the group eventually captured Kaladin, Vai was wary of him, giving him little in the way of attention. Instead, she remained close to her father, though later asked Kaladin if he would go back and tell their slavers that they didn't want any trouble, but just wanted to get away.\r\nAfter reaching Revolar, Vai was removed from her father's care by the Fused when her group was sent with Moash to lead the attack on Kholinar. Though angered, Sah didn't know what to do about it, and paid the ultimate price with his life in the siege. Kaladin later recalled how all Sah ever wanted was to protect his daughter.",
