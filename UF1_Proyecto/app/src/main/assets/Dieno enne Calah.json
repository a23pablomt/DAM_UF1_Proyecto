        "Biography": "",
        "Appearance": "He is the shortest of his men, is missing a tooth, and bears a thin, silvered mustache on his upper lip. His sun-leathered skin is darker than that of most Herdazians, and so much so that he could almost pass for Azish. His eyes are a deep dark brown.\r\nFurther, there is a power to his lean build, though the scars around his wrists are those that manacles make on the skin of slaves.",
        "Personality": "",
        "History": "He likes execution by greatshell, when a person is chained near a shore and covered with grease, as he did to Sheler. He himself was so chained and got out.
