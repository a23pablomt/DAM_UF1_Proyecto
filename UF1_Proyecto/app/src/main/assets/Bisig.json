    "characterDescription": "Bisig is a bridgeman in Bridge Four. He was the last of the holdouts amongst slaves, thieves, deserters, and foreigners to follow Kaladin.\r\nBisig is hugged by Rock shortly after Rock received the gift of a razor by Maps from the members of Bridge Four. This causes Bisig to nearly spill his bowl of stew that Rock had prepared for his crew.\r\nHe is one of the first few amongst the bridgemen to draw in Stormlight as one of Kaladin's squires. This should fix his hand as he had been injured by the Assassin in White.",
