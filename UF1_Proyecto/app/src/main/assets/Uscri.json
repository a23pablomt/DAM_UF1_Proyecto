    "characterDescription": "Uscri is a figure from a tragic poem written seventeen hundred years ago, from the present day. She drowned herself in the sea after hearing her lover had died, though the truth was that he'd not died at all, and she misunderstood the report about him.\r\nAccording to Adrotagia, Uscri was used in following centuries as an example of acting without information, though the term \"Uscritic\" eventually came to simply mean 'stupid,' an insult.\r\n",
