    "characterDescription": "Karm is the name by which Nohadon refers to Dalinar in one of Dalinar's visions. Nohadon questions Karm as to whether he's using his own sayings against him.\r\nWhen Nohadon states that he is thinking of giving up his throne, Karm\/Dalinar tells him that he mustn't, that he cannot, that the people need a leader.\r\nApparently, Karm is an old friend of Nohadon's who can read him too well. He's also the only man of letters that Nohadon knows who's still alive.\r\nWhen asked how Nohadon might protect his people, Karm tells him to dictate a book, a grand book to give people hope, to explain his philosophy on leadership and how lives should be lived.\r\nNohadon thinks this to be a fantastically stupid idea.\r\nStill, Nohadon apologized to him for dismissing Karm's suggestions right after asking for them.",
