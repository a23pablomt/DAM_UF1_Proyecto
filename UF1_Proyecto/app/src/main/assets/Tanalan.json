    "characterDescription": "Tanalan was a Shardbearer with only a Shardblade whom Dalinar claimed was his own to challenge to his brother Gavilar. In response, Gavilar said he'd had half a mind to give Tanalan's Blade to Sadeas.\r\nTanalan had raised an army and settled into his fortifications. Gavilar thought that the other highprinces were encouraging Tanalan because they wanted to see how their king handled the situation.\r\nDalinar had bested him after falling down into the Rift itself. It was a furious fight across wooden bridges and then in a garden suspended from the side of the chasm.\r\n",
