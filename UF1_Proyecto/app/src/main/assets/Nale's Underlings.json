        "Appearance": "They are described as being uniformed in black and white, with swords at their waists.\r\nThe male is described as appearing as a Makabaki, and, according to Lift, with a round, goofish face.\r\nThe female is described as appearing with skin a shade lighter. Again, according to Lift, she looks like she might be Reshi, particularly with her long dark hair that she keeps in a tight braid. She has a square face, strong shoulders, and way too small a nose. Like she'd sold her's off to buy some new shoes, and was using one she'd dug out of the trash as a replacement.\r\nBoth wear uniforms with high boots, stiff Eastern jackets, and large-cuffed gloves. Lift describes them as imposing, like generals on a field.",
