        "Biography": "",
        "Appearance": "To Adolin, she seems to be made entirely from mist, all save for her face, which hovers on the front of her head in the shape of a porcelain mask. That mask has a kind of twinkling reflection to it, always catching the light. In fact, Adolin could've sworn that from some perspectives it was made of translucent crystal. To him, the spren seems to be female, or at least has a feminine figure and voice.\r\nShe wears a vest and trousers, both of which somehow float and encapsulate her body made entirely of white fog. Her hands end in gloves.",
