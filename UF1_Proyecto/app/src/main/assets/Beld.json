    "characterDescription": "Beld was a member of Bridge Four who did not have a slave mark, but the tattoos of freedom that Kaladin had designed. He was freed from Bridge Four when Dalinar traded his Shardblade, Oathbringer, to Sadeas for the bridgemen who'd rescued him and his men on the Shattered Plains after Sadeas's deception.\r\nAs a member of the King's Guard, he was instructed by Kaladin - along with Hobber - to provide an advance guard for the evacuation of Elhokar and Dalinar from the palace when it had been determined that it wasn't safe for them there.. Beld was told by Kaladin to scout the building - the back way, through the kitchens - and to give a shout if he (or Hobber) saw anything unusual.\r\nBeld died at the hands of Szeth in an assassination attempt on Dalinar at the Pinnacle. He was run through by Szeth's Honorblade and was killed immediately. His eyes were burned out. He had survived Damnation itself, only to fall to an assassin with powers he shouldn't have had.",
