They discussed Dalinar's position given his condition during highstorms.\r\nShe is later revealed to be a co-conspirator in the plotted assassination of King Elhokar. She is present at a meeting at which are in attendance Moash, Graves, Rill, and one unidentified man, to which Kaladin was invited by Moash. She asks of Kaladin whether he has any idea of the kinds of policies the king put into place before Dalinar got him under control, indicating that she spent the past three years in Kholinar helping the clerks there sort through the mess he'd made of the royal codes.\r\nWith regard to the plot, she tells Kaladin that the Blackthorn must take the throne. Further, that it will happen eventually. She tells him that she and her co-conspirators want to help Dalinar along, for his own good ... to spare him the difficult decision.",
