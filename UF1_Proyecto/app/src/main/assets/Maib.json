    "characterDescription": "Maib is a Purelaker woman of whom Ishikk is fond. She continually tries to keep him in her debt so that she can 'catch' him (as he would 'owe' her), with the idea in mind that one day she would get him to marry her.\r\nMaib's house is near the center of the village. Ishikk isn't sure what makes her want to live inside the building.\r\nShe is a very good cook and, as such, runs her village's version of an inn. She serves food and drink to Ishikk and the foreigners, Grump, Blunt and Thinker, when they meet to discuss the whereabouts of Hoid.",
