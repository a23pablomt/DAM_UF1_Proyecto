    "characterDescription": "Roion was a highprince of Alethkar. He had great archers, superior to those of the other highprinces. However, he won the fewest gemhearts of all of the highprinces.\r\nRoion was one of only three highprinces to, quite unexpectedly, accompany Dalinar to the center of the Shattered Plains to assault the Parshendi and locate the Oathgate.\r\nWhen Dalinar was attacked by Szeth near the center of the Shattered Plains, Roion attempted to defend him and was lashed to a point in the sky by Szeth. He later plummeted from the sky and and hit the ground with a sickening crunch. Roion was pronounced dead by Dalinar, stating that he fell with honor.",

        "Personality": "Roion is described as cowardly by many and has been compared to a turtle on more than one occasion. However at the battle at the end of Words of Radiance, Dalinar says that Roion is not cowardly but careful - and in his defence of Dalinar he showed real bravery.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\nRoion is not a key character in the book, so doesn't really have any personality traits other than cowardice until his surprising alliance with Dalinar towards the end of his life. Otherwise he is presumably a lot like the other highprinces in his greed and squabbles as he often gets lumped together with them when Dalinar mentions them.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\n",
