He couldn't do so unless she settled down, as he expressed to \"her.\"\r\nShallan, as Talesh, indicated to Amaram that Hav had stopped a messenger on the perimeter of the manor who had been coming for Amaram. Further, still in disguise, Shallan tells Amaram that Hav had sent her back to tell him so.",
