    "characterDescription": "Dova is an ardent who, on her own, discovered the work of King Taravangian, Adrotagia, and Taravangian's covenant of Silent Gatherers with regard to the collection of the death rattles. She reports to Adrotagia that the number of death rattles is dropping.\r\nTaravangian determines that Dova needs to either be inducted into his covenant or assassinated. Ultimately, he decides that she should continue her work because the Diagram and its members, know no boundaries.\r\nLater, Taravangian directs Adrotagia to assign to Dova a scathing, anonymous essay regarding some translated passages - according to him - that they'd needed (i.e.,  information from Malata's spying).\r\nHe indicates that the essay should be leaked to Tashikk and that Navani's translations of Dalinar's visions from the Dawnchant (which he's appropriated) should be included to 'strike at once'.\r\nDova has been identified by Taravangian as Battah'Elin, a Herald (i.e., Battar). Taravangian says, \" ... she told us the Desolation was approaching.\"",
