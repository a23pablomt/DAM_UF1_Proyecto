        "Biography": "Iyatil is 'from' three different places. She now lives on Roshar, but she's from a different place, yet that place isn't the world from which her people come.\r\nAnother of these three places is Scadrial: in Shadows of Self, there's a story in one of the broadsheets about someone seeing a woman with a scary mask emerging from a pool of water in the mountains. This is likely Iyatil, returning from Roshar via Scadrial's perpendicularity.\r\nLastly, there is a place \u2013 yet not a world \u2013 in the cosmere where a lot of Worldhoppers have settled; it is where Iyatil is from, even though her ethnicity is not from there. This place is Silverlight, and Iyatil is a Malwish Southerner \u2013 a Hunter? \u2013 though she was not born on Scadrial. She wears a mask; it might grow into her face, just as do those of the Hunters.

        "Appearance": "Iyatil is a short, tan-skinned woman who wears a carapace mask tied to her face.\r\nBehind the mask, she has unblinking dark eyes and an impassive mouth. She wears simple, dark brown clothing tied with an intricate belt, studded with more carapace.",
        "Personality": "Iyatil is very self-contained, revealing little about herself, until she encounters Shallan. She professes to Shallan to be Mraize's master (instead of the other way around, which Shallan has assumed, based on her previous encounters with Mraize).\r\nMraize refers to Iyatil as his 'babsk,' a master\/apprentice relationship used in Thaylenah. This indicates that Mraize is Thaylen.",
