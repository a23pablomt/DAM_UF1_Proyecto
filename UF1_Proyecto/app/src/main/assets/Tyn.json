        "Personality": "Tyn was intent on her own interests ... always. She would've killed Shallan (without regret) given the opportunity.[citation\u00a0needed]\r\nHowever, Tyn often chose to have someone like Shallan - an acolyte, someone to nurture - under her wing. Shallan suspected that was at least partly because Tyn liked having someone around to impress.\r\nTyn was insistent in that the life she lead required doing some harsh things.",
        "History": "Tyn was raised in Tu Bayla by parents who worked as interpreters.\r\nLater, she was described by Macob as head of the guards for his caravan.\r\nShe suggested to Macob that in conveying Shallan to the Shattered Plains they could use her soldiers because her own force was reduced to a handful.\r\nLater still, Tyn revealed to Shallan that she had a spanreed and a contact in Tashikk, who gathered what information he could on House Davar.\r\nMore recently, she was an associate of the Ghostbloods.",
