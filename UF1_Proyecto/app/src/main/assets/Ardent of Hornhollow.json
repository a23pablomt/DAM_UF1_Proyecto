    "characterDescription": "An ardent of Hornhollow is described as being young, pretty, and nervous.\r\nAccording to Kaladin, she didn't know where he fit into the scheme of her religion.\r\nEven so, she tells him that of the five eyewitnesses to an attack on them by rogue parshmen, four independently counted the number of attackers at fifty or so. She says that it's safe to say that they've got large numbers, considering how many sacks of grain they were able to carry away in such a short time.\r\nFurther, she says that they didn't look exactly like parshmen. That they were too tall, and wearing armor.\r\nShe tells Kaladin that they attacked right after first moonset. That they had the grain out by middle of second moon, and that they didn't hear anything until the change of guard happened. That Sot raised the alarm, which chased the creatures off. That they left only four sacks, which she and her fellow ardents moved.\r\nKaladin tells her that she did well and thank her for her report.\r\nFurther still, Syl tells Kaladin - while sitting on the ardent's shoulder - that the ardent thinks he's pretty.",
