        "Characteristics": "Thinker was described by Ishikk as thoughtful, with Alethi-like light tan skin, but wrongly shaped eyes and accent. For these, Ishikk decided he was certainly not Alethi. He spoke the Selay language worse than his two companions, and usually stayed quiet.\r\nAs Demoux, he viewed Kelsier as a god and was a preacher in the Church of the Survivor.\r\nGiven Demoux's religious fervor, there's still a reason he's not a Ghostblood, though Brandon won't yet go into that.",
