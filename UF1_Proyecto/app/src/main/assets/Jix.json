He escorts Shallan to the gambling pavilion during Middlefest where she seeks out her brother, Balat.\r\nHe offers to go into the patched and ripped tarp strung up at the edge of the fairgrounds for her, but she pushes forward while Jix remains at her side, shoving her some space.\r\nWhen he asks her if there's something specific she's looking for, she tells him axehound fights. He then tells her that she's going to end up stabbed, and that he'll end up on a roasting spit. That this is crazy.\r\nStill, when Shallan steps up to Balat, Jix remains a little way behind her. But, once he sees Balat, he relaxes.\r\nOnce Shallan completes her exchange with Balat, she lets Jix lead the way back toward their box and her father.",
