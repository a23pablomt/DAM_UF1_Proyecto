    "characterDescription": "Tag is one of Tvlakv's mercenaries. He, along with Bluth, is a 'right hand man' to Tvlakv. Both are responsible for keeping the slaves in line and hitching the chulls to their harnesses for pulling the slaver's wagons.\r\nWhen around commissioned troops, Bluth and Tag played their part, walking with their chests out and hands on their weapons. They shoved a few of the slaves into place, but stayed clear of Kaladin.\r\nHe was also one amongst Shallan's caravan across the Shattered Plains.",
