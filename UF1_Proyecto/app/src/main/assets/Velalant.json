    "characterDescription": "Velalant is Brightlord of House Velalant in Kholinar. He is described by Yokska as a minor player in the city until so many lighteyes had vanished into the palace.\r\nWhen Velalant's soldiers appropriated a grain dispensary, Veil would have applauded his kindness, save for his soldiers' blatant incompetence in dealing with the city's people.\r\nFurther, she sees that Velalant's men really have no idea how to distribute grain amongst the people. But she thinks that maybe they know exactly what they're doing, and Velalant is just keeping the local lighteyes happy and ready to support his rule, should the winds turn his way.\r\nStill, she wonders from just where Velalant gets the food.\r\nKaladin wonders why Velalant's men collect the grain that the Wall Guard delivers for the people during the day. Why the display when his men could collect it from the barracks' warehouse and escort it from there.\r\nHe asks Beard why they pay off the highlords, because Velalant and his type are pretty useless, from what he's seen.\r\nBeard suspects that if they didn't share with people like Velalant, they'd have to fight them off from seizing the grain.",
