It is a poem about a wedding band.\r\nShe carries Amaram's old Shardbow and wears the full set of Shardplate she'd found in Aimia.",

        "Appearance": "She looks different from the Alethi. More solid, a person who wouldn\u2019t be blown over by a storm, as if she is made of bronze \u2014 a shade subtly reflected by her skin tone. Her red hair is different from Shallan\u2019s: more rusty, darker and deeper; she wears it in a tail, tied with a ribbon.",
