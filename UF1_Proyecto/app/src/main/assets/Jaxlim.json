She worked her shalebark rows outside her home. In continuing to wear workform, even after the discovery of nimbleform, she said that she didn't want to encourage people to see one form as more valuable than another, that such stratification could destroy them.\r\nShe has been described as suffering from dementia. Eshonai believes she's no longer fully alive, yet Jaxlim understands that Venli will need a storm for her transformation.",
