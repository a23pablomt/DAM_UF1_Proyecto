His wares are fruits.\r\nWhen Tiqqa swipes a whole basket of fruit from him, he shouts for her to stop.\r\nSoon afterward, he thanks Darkness for apprehending the thief, calling him \"officer.\"\r\nHowever, when Darkness then kills the girl with his Shardblade, the shopkeeper screams, dropping the basket of fruit she'd stolen.\r\nThe shopkeeper receives a writ of witness from Darkness - who prods him to sign it - thereby forcing the shopkeeper to also witness the killing in pen, and write a short description of what had happened.\r\nWith the fruit spilled at his feet, the shopkeeper stares at Tiqqa's corpse, angerspren boiling up around him. He demands of Darkness whether what he had done was necessary, stating that it was barbaric.\r\nThe shopkeeper cringes as Darkness regards him, addresses him, then walks away.",
