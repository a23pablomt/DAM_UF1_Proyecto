    "characterDescription": "Rial is a soldier in Dalinar's army, holding the rank of sergeant. He tries to be extra careful with regard to Dalinar because he doesn't want to be reported for being disrespectful.\r\nDalinar had previously chastised him for filling his canteen with alcohol instead of water. Instead, Rial keeps his alcohol in his flask in the right leg pocket of his uniform.\r\nNavani thinks Rial to be an unfitting, greasy man. She suggests to Dalinar that he could have someone else assigned to guard him, but Dalinar actually likes him. Rial reminds Dalinar of some of his friends from the old days.\r\nRial is one amongst Dalinar's men who is present before and during the duel between Dalinar and F'en Rnamdi's son that has to swear an oath that if the duel goes poorly for Dalinar, the young man will not be named an assassin.\r\nLater, Rial becomes one of Teft's squires.",
