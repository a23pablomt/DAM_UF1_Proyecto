    "characterDescription": "NanKhet, the ancient king of Silnasen in Jah Keved (in addition to his brother, NanHar), held the throne for only three months.\r\nJasnah had long been interested in NanKhet's death, because of that rule. He'd succeeded to the throne when the previous king, his brother NanHar, had taken ill and died while on campaign in what would become modern Triax.\r\nRemarkably, during the brief span of his reign, NanKhet survived six assassination attempts. The first had come from his sister, who had wanted to place her husband on the throne.
