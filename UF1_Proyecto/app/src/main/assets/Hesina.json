One of her parents is lighteyed and they are of a higher social standing than their daughter, so Hesina grew up wealthy for a darkeyes.\r\nThe initial meeting between Lirin and Hesina's parents goes quite poorly. Afterward, her parents are rarely mentioned, particularly around her children, though she is still in contact with them.\r\nJust after the arrival of Brightlord Roshone in Hearthstone, Hesina suggests to Lirin that perhaps the Brightlord didn't feel he needed everyone to dote on him since he hadn't announced his arrival.\r\nWhen her family falls on tough times after the arrival of Roshone, Hesina's parents offer aid to her family.",

At times, she wears a knit hat over that.\r\nShe also has a long brown coat that matches that of her son, Kaladin, and the blue hem of her skirt just barely peeks out of it at the bottom.\r\nShe wears a glove over her safehand and is taller than her husband by a few fingers.",

However, she occasionally assists if multiple helpers are required.\r\nShe is thrilled that Kaladin has returned to her alive, as she and her husband thought him dead along with Tien. She is therefore protective of him.\r\nWhen Kaladin reveals himself to be a Knight Radiant, she  clutches her infant child in her arms, her expression one of pure delight, and an awespren bursts around her head in a blue ring.",
