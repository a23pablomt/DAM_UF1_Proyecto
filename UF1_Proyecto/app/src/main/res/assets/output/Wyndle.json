    "characterDescription": "Wyndle is a Cultivationspren that Invests those Knights Radiant Surgebinders who are Edgedancers, such as Lift, with the Surges of Abrasion and Progression (i.e., manipulating friction and the power of Growth).\r\nWyndle frequently complains that he was told to bond Lift, while his preference was for a person of importance. The Ring instructed Wyndle to bond Lift as she had visited the Nightwatcher and received a boon.\r\nThrough their bond, Wyndle is responsible for Lift's \"awesomeness\", but she refers to him as a Voidbringer.\r\nLift isn't supposed to be able to touch Wyndle, but she can. He states that he doesn't have enough presence in the Physical Realm, even with their bond, that she must be stuck partially in the Cognitive Realm. She thinks this is gibberish.\r\nHe cannot believe that this is now his existence. Emphatically, he states that he was a gardener. Respected."
