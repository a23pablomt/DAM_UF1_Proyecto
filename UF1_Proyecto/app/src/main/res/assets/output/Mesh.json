    "characterDescription": "Mesh was a squadleader in  Amaram's army in Alethkar. He assumed that Kaladin was one of his reinforcements when Kaladin approached his squad looking for Tien. Mesh yelled after Kaladin when Kaladin had spotted Tien positioned in the middle front of the squad formation.\r\nMesh's orders were to hold against the east assault in the battle during which Tien was killed, yet Mesh's squad broke, losing their discipline, and turned to a more frenzied, unorganized resistance."
