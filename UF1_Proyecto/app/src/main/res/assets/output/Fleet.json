    "characterDescription": "Fleet is a character in one of Wit's stories with which he regales Kaladin through music played on a stringed instrument. Like all of Wit's stories, he tells the story of Fleet to make a point.\r\nFleet is supposed to have been the fastest man ever to have lived. He raced the Herald, Chanarach, and won. His goal was to beat the wind, and race a storm, thereby tempting the God of Storms."
