    "characterDescription": "Moash's grandparents were of the second nahn, which is coincidentally the same as Lirin and Kaladin.\r\nThey were also silversmiths in Kholinar at a time when King Elhokar was young and new to his position.\r\nRoshone, a petty man, had become a trusted friend and advisor to Elhokar. Roshone owned a few silversmith shops in Kholinar and disliked having competition. Using his connections to the king, he was able to convince Elhokar to jail several of his competitors on trumped up charges, including the grandparents of Moash, a Bridge Four soldier.\r\nMoash's grandparents died in Elhokar's prison because Elhokar simply forgot about them. Conversely, Moash never forgot about Elhokar's role in the demise of his grandparents. He held a grudge against Elhokar, which, ultimately, resulted in Elhokar's death, after previous attempts."
