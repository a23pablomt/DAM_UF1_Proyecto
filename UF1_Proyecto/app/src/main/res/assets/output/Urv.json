    "characterDescription": "Urv is an ardent in the Devotary of the Mind at Jokasha Monastery in Jah Keved.\r\nAccording to Urv, Ellista was the last amongst them all to check out the transcriptions from Bendthel's collected Dawnchant. He wanted to check up on her progress in the translation process of the old versions, after Navani Kholin had cracked the Dawnchant in Alethkar.\r\nAfter Ellista hands him a sheaf of papers from her satchel, Urv thinks it incredible that she had made more progress than he had."
