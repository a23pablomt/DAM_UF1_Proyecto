    "characterDescription": "Teshav Khal is a scribe and the wife of one of Dalinar's officers, General Khal. Apparently, she always needs something to worry about. For the most part, though, Dalinar trusts her.\r\nShe tells Dalinar that Adolin had asked her to report the progress of the saddle girth investigation. She says that Adolin was speaking with leatherworkers at this very moment, but so far, there was very little to say. That nobody witnessed anyone interfering with the saddle or the king's horse. Further, she says that their spies have said that there are no whispers of anyone in the other warcamps bragging, and no one in their own camp has suddenly received large sums of money, so far as they'd discovered."
