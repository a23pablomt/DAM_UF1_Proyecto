    "characterDescription": "Rysn Ftori is a Thaylen apprentice merchant to Vstim, whom she finds to be a very strange but knowledgeable person, and from whom she can learn a lot about mercantile enterprise.\u00a0She is a practitioner of\u00a0Vorinism\u00a0to keep up appearances, but she does not particularly take some of the traditions to heart; she finds covering her safehand merely a silly tradition.\u00a0She is also very observant, as evidenced by her listening to a sales pitch between her master and a Shin farmer called Thresh-son-Esan. From it, she deduces that the Shin haggle to undermine their products, rather than boasting about them."
