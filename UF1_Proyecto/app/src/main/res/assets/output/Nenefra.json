    "characterDescription": "Nenefra is the painter of a unique piece, from the far-off Court of Gods in Shadesmar on Roshar.\r\nAccording to Kaladin, the piece is sloppy by comparison to others beside it, which show far more technical prowess. To him, it looks like the painter had simply taken a knife covered in paint and slopped it onto the canvas, making general shapes. Haunting, beautiful shapes. Mostly reds and whites, but with a figure at the center, throwing out nine shadows.\r\nWhen Kaladin reaches up to touch the painting, a Reacher woman (short, with a bronze ponytail) tells him that it's a painting intended for only divinity to see.\r\nFurther, she tells him that it's exceptionally rare that one such piece escapes being burned at the court, and makes its way onto the market. When Kaladin asks her whether the piece is of the Unmade, she tells him that it's said that each person who sees one of Nenefra's masterworks sees something different."
