    "characterDescription": "The Rii Oracle is an alter-ego of the lighthouse keeper, Riino, in Shadesmar.\r\nWhen Kaladin visits him (as Riino) at his residence there, the Oracle tells Kaladin that he has come to witness the extraordinary, and that he - the Oracle - shall provide it. Further, that the price is a mere two marks of Stormlight.\r\nWhen the man then whips a cloth off a table, he reveals a large crystalline globe. It glows with a powerful light, bathing the room in luminescence.\r\nKaladin blinks at it, wondering whether it's Stormlight.\r\nSeeing Kaladin's hesitancy, the Oracle asks him if he's balking at the price and launches into a  philosophical statement on the spending of money. Kaladin tells the man that he doesn't know what he's talking about.\r\nWhen the man asks Kaladin to confirm that he came there for a fortune, Kaladin tells him that the future is forbidden.*\r\nThe Oracle then asks Kaladin isn't this why he came to see him, to which Kaladin replies that he's looking for passage because he and his companions had heard that ships come by there."
