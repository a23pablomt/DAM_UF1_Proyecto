    "characterDescription": "Coreb was one of Kaladin's friends and a highly skilled warrior in Kaladin's squad of soldiers in Amaram's army. He was the most skilled amongst them to survive the attack of the anonymous Shardbearer (i.e., Helaran).\r\nHaving won the Shardbearer's Plate and Blade and not wanting them, Kaladin states to Amaram that he wants the Shards to be given to Coreb; that Coreb is the highest ranked of his soldiers and the best fighter among them. Kaladin knew that Coreb would take care of them ... once he was a lighteyes.\r\nInstead, Amaram's attendants murdered the last four of Kaladin's squad to survive the attack: Reesh, Hab, Alabet, then Coreb at Amaram's instruction.\r\nCoreb lasted the longest, though one of Amaram's men eventually severed his head from his neck."
