    "characterDescription": "Song is the name of affection by which Rock's wife is known. She stands up tall and raises a bow toward him when found on the Shattered Plains. He pulls her close, one arm around her shoulders.\r\nShe rubs his back, then kneels down beside him, pulling their daughter close with one arm, her husband with the other. She tells him that it was a long journey, and longest at the end, when those things came from the sky.\r\nKnowing that Kef'ha is dead, she asks Rock what happened to him."
