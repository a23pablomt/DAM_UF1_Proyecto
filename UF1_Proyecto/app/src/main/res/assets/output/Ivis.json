    "characterDescription": "Ivis is an Ardent whom Zahel entrusted with the training of Adolin and Kaladin in the art of sword fighting with a Shardblade. Though she was an Ardent, she kept her hand gloved, which was some acknowledgement of her gender, even if her flowing clothing and shaved head masked some of the other obvious signs.\r\nKaladin thought that a woman with a sword was an odd sight, but that it wasn't any odder than a darkeyed man holding a Shardblade.\r\nIvis gave Adolin and Kaladin lengths of wood that, given their weight and balance, were decent approximations of Shardblades. She then put them through several routines, demonstrating the ten Shardblade stances."
