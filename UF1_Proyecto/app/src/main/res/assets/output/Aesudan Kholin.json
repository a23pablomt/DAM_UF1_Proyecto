    "characterDescription": "Aesudan Kholin was Queen of Alethkar by marriage to her husband, Elhokar Kholin, formerly King of Alethkar.\r\nIn her husband's absence from the kingdom, the queen surrounds herself with many sycophantic ardents who indulge her every whim. Lhan states to Pai that the queen likes to feel that those around her are refined. That it makes her feel refined by association. The queen, in turn, treats these sycophants well - nice food, nice robes, fantastic quarters, lots of free time to do whatever they want, warm baths, horseback riding using the queen's personal stables, music, and art - thinking it will buy her favor with the One who makes the storms. Lhan reveals that she worries that the Almighty isn't pleased with her.\r\nIn her time as regent during the War of Reckoning, Queen Aesudan cancelled the Beggars' Feast, which Pai deemed reprehensible.\r\nPai states that the queen is excessive; throwing feasts every night, engaging in debauchery, wasting food and money while Alethkar languishes. Aesudan has yet to actually 'weigh in' on such accusations, but she has Pai executed for them nonetheless.\r\nThe Thaylen tailor Yokska tells Elhokar that the queen had basically vanished; that the people would get proclamations from her, but they often didn't make much sense."
