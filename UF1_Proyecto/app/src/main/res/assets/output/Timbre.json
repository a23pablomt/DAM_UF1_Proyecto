    "characterDescription": "Timbre is a lightspren originally meant for -  and who began bonding with - Eshonai, yet later was encountered by Venli after Venli had discovered Eshonai's corpse.\r\nAfter experiencing the transformation of her once-mate Demid, plus that of Melu, Altoki, and Mrun, Venli again discovers the little spren that looks like a ball of light, which seems agitated, as it scoots closer to her. She instantly knows something - an instinctive truth, that if the Fused standing nearby see this spren, they'll destroy it. She slaps her hand down over the spren as the creature (i.e., Hariel) wearing Demid's body turns toward her. She cups the little spren against the stone close to her.\r\nTimbre is now in the process of bonding with Venli, despite that Venli was initially reluctant to do so, thinking that the better sister with whom to bond had died. Still, Venli starts interacting with Timbre more after she learns that she's able to communicate with the spren through listener rhythms. Venli names her Timbre as a result.\r\nTimbre is kept by Venli in a pouch, yet she peeks around, looking in corners and shadowed places each time Venli lets her out."
