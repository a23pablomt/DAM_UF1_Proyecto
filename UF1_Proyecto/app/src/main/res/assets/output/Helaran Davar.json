    "characterDescription": "Helaran Davar, formerly known as Nan Helaran, was the eldest son of Brightlord Lin Davar, and brother to Nan Balat, Asha Jushu, Tet Wikim, and Shallan. He was the only one of the Davar children who stood up to his father's brutal temper and blamed him for the murder of his mother.\r\nHelaran was a full Shardbearer who was later killed by Kaladin. His Shardblade and Shardplate were stolen from Kaladin by Brightlord Amaram.\r\nHelaran's father knew that his eldest son was a Shardbearer and attempted his assassination through Rin, the newest Captain of the Guard of House Davar whilst Shallan was still a child.\r\nPrior to his death, Helaran was suspected to be investigating an order of Knights Radiant known as the Skybreakers. He might have been a Surgebinder himself as Taravangian suspected him of teaching Surgebinding to Shallan before he was killed.\r\nMraize questioned Shallan about Helaran during his confrontation with her after their arrival in Urithiru through the Oathgate.\r\nHe was a minion of Nale who was to kill people that bonded with spren and could potentially become Knights Radiant."
