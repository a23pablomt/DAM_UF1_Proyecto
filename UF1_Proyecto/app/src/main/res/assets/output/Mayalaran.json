    "characterDescription": "Mayalaran is the name with which Adolin's dead spren Shardblade identifies herself to him by tickling his mind, very faint, like a sigh. Upon learning this, he affectionately calls her Maya and invites her to bring down a thunderclast with him.\r\nWhen she was alive, she was a cultivationspren and an Edgedancer's Blade.\r\nAdolin tells her that he's guessed that she used to be alive. That others say they can hear her screaming if they touch her. That she's dead, yet somehow still in pain. He's sorry that he can't do anything about that, but\u00a0thanks her for assisting him over the years. He also tells her that he's going to use her to do good things. That he'll always try use her that way.\r\nWhile in Shadesmar, she's known as a deadeye."
