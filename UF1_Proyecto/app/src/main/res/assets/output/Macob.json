    "characterDescription": "Macob is the leader of a merchants' caravan. His accent places him as neither Thaylen nor Alethi.\r\nAfter an encounter with bandits, he speaks of Shallan as his caravan's savior.\r\nHis associate is Tyn.\r\nShallan notices that Macob has nice wagons and goods aplenty, and because she's in dreadful need of a little luxury, she asks him and his crew to accompany her to the Shattered Plains.\r\nHe makes an accord with Shallan to convey her, as a lighteyed Alethi noblewoman should be, guarding her safely to her destination.\r\nHowever, he requests that she keep Tvlakv and Tag at the back of the caravan; he'd rather not his caravan stink of those wares."
