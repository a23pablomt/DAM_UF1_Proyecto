He is one of the Unmade, a mysterious group of odious spren on Roshar.\r\nShallan senses him in Kholinar even before she enters the revel atop the Oathgate in the city. Wit has confirmed his presence in Kholinar to Shallan, and she thinks that the way the queen acted leading up to the riots there seems an obvious sign confirming this."
