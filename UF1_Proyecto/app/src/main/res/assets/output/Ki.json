    "characterDescription": "Ki is a master Skybreaker who trains the squires beneath her outside the Skybreaker fortress near the Purelake. She takes Szeth on as her own squire.\r\nWhen he then asks her if he might swear the Second Ideal, she tells him that he may. That justice will serve him until he attracts a spren and swears to a more specific code. Further, that during her prayers of the previous night, her spren Winnow proclaimed that the highspren are watching him. She tells him that she won't be surprised if it takes mere months before he achieves the Third Ideal."
