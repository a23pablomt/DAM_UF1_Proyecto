    "characterDescription": "Thakka is the captain of Dalinar's elites of thirty-four years ago.\r\nHe is present when Dalinar is pierced in the shoulder by an arrow shot by an enemy archer. Thakka is concerned for his Brightlord's well-being.\r\nShortly thereafter, Thakka confirms for Dalinar that the distance from which the archer fired his shot was almost four hundred yards, but with a height advantage.\r\nLater still, Thakka confirms for Dalinar that the fellow he'd killed down below the precipice on which they currently stood was, in fact, the Brightlord that the archer named as his price for joining Dalinar's army.\r\nAfterward, Thakka sought out the archer's family out of respect."
