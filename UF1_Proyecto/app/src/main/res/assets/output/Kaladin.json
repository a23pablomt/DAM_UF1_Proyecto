    "characterDescription": "Kaladin is one of the main protagonists in The Stormlight Archive. An accomplished spearman and a natural leader, he eventually becomes the captain of Elhokar Kholin's King's Guard, formerly known as the Cobalt Guard, House Kholin's personal honor guard.\r\nHe is known by many as Kaladin Stormblessed, a nickname given to him by his squad in Amaram's army as a result of his uncanny luck and tendency to have the fewest casualties. The name was again given to him by his fellow bridgemen, but it would soon spread to the entirety of Sadeas's warcamp.  (Notably, his bridge squad earned a reputation for losing the fewest members amongst any in the army.) Following Bridge Four's rescue of Dalinar's army after Sadeas's betrayal, the crew became famous throughout the warcamps and Kaladin became known to most therein as Kaladin Stormblessed.* He has risen further than any darkeyes could dare to hope, gaining the trust and admiration of both lighteyes and darkeyes.\r\nHe is one of the first few Surgebinders to reappear following the Recreance, and by the end of Rhythm of War, he has spoken the Fourth Ideal of the Windrunners."
