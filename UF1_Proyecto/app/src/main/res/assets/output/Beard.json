    "characterDescription": "Beard is a member of the Wall Guard in Kholinar.\r\nHe tells Kaladin that he used to do secret missions for Amaram back in his operative days. He says that it's a good story and that he'll tell it sometime.\r\nHe claims that the barracks recipe for flatbread is his own. That he is a chef who learned it from a Horneater mystic at the top of a mountain.\r\nWith regard to Kaladin joining the Wall Guard, Beard says that if he knows how to kill people, it's good enough for them.\r\nWith regard to Highmarshal Azure, he tells Kaladin that they don't talk about the marshal's secret (i.e., that she is not a he).\r\nBeard claims that he met the Blackthorn. That the man complimented him on his uniform, and that he gave him his own knife for valor.\r\nUpon seeing Adolin wearing a false face and a yellow suit after the new fashionable style, Beard tells of an experience he had in Steen. When he was done there, he still wasn't as colorful as the preening cremling.\r\nHe tells Kaladin that he can't go around trusting middlers (such as men like what he saw of Adolin), unless they're good officers like the highmarshal.\r\nSeriousness aside, he says that one day he'll have to infiltrate the Cult of Moments, maybe marry their high priestess. He admits though that he's terrible in a harem.\r\nWhen Kaladin asks him whether he'd known anyone in the Palace Guard ranks, Beard tells him that he got close to the palace a little while back. That he heard voices whispering to him to join them. He tells Kaladin that the highmarshal said they have to close their ears to those. That unless they listen, they can't be taken.\r\nAfter Kaladin kills one of the Fused during their attack upon the wall, Beard exclaims that he actually did so.\r\nWhen Beard asks Kaladin if he knows the Blackthorn, Kal tells him better than most. When Beard then asks Kaladin whether he knows that Beard and the Blackthorn never actually swam in the Purelake together, Kal tells him yes, and that he suspects the rest of the squad guessed that already."
