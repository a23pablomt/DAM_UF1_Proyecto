    "characterDescription": "Dalinar Kholin is one of the main protagonists in The Stormlight Archive. He is the king of Urithiru and was a famous former Shardbearer. During his youth, he helped his brother, King Gavilar, to unite Alethkar, then a country of ten individual princedoms. His prowess in battle was enough to earn him the singular title of The Blackthorn.\r\nWhile he was a Shardbearer, his Shardblade was named Oathbringer. Unlike most Alethi Shardbearers, he chose to wear his plate without decorations, leaving it in its original slate grey color. Like his son, Adolin, he rides a Ryshadium: a black horse named Gallant.\r\nIn the present time, he is much more infrequently that warrior who inspired awe and terror, but instead a thoughtful leader, seeking the unification of Alethkar above all else, even at the expense of his reputation. By the end of Words of Radiance, he has discovered his Surgebinding capacity and has spoken the second Ideal of the Bondsmiths. His spren is the Stormfather."
