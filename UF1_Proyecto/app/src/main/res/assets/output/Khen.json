    "characterDescription": "Khen is a freed Parshendi singer in Kholinar who led a group of her kind (along with the Voidspren Yixli) toward Revolar. She was joined by Sah and his daughter, Vai, once they'd escaped from a village near Hearthstone when the Everstorm first passed.\r\nKhen's group (via Sah) \"captured\" Kaladin along the way when he surrendered to them.\r\nLater, once enslaved by the Fused, Khen tells Sah that they were set up. That the Fused knew they had too few humans strong enough to run their first assault upon the Alethi. That they needed some of the parsh in there, so they found a reason to toss them out to die."
