    "characterDescription": "Loradar Vamah, or Vamah, is a highprince of Alethkar. He wields no Shardblade.\r\nVamah complains vocally about the fees that King Elhokar charges to use his Soulcasters. He was invited by Highprince Sadeas to Elhokar's chasmfiend hunt. There, he was very unsubtly reminded by Highprince Dalinar how generous the king is with loaning his Soulcasters, for things like wood, after Sadeas just informed him he was increasing what he charges for wood."
