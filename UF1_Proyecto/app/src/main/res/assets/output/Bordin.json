    "characterDescription": "Bordin is the driver of the wagon that delivered Taln to former King Elhokar and Dalinar, on the Shattered Plains. He had to listen to Taln rant in the back of the wagon half the time, and feel Taln staring at the back of his head during the rest.\r\nHe mentions that Wit started the trip with him, yet, on the second day, Wit abandoned him. Bordin thought that Wit was mocking him due to the perplexity of Wit's actions. He then stated that he preferred the madman (i.e., Taln) for company.\r\nLater in the conversation, Dalinar mentions that he might have need of Bordin.\r\nWith Bordin's help, Dalinar set a trap for Amaram using the madman's Shardblade, to see what Amaram would do; Amaram had taken Shard and lied about it."
